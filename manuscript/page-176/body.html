Since the campaigns of Austerlitz and of 1807 Rost贸v knew by experience that men always lie when describing military exploits, as he himself had done when recounting them; besides that, he had experience enough to know that nothing happens in war at all as we can imagine or relate it. And so he did not like Zdrzhinski&rsquo;s tale, nor did he like Zdrzhinski himself who, with his mustaches extending over his cheeks, bent low over the face of his hearer, as was his habit, and crowded Rost贸v in the narrow shanty. Rost贸v looked at him in silence.</p></div> </div>
