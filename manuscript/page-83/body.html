I know the number of your battalions as exactly as I know my own. You have not two hundred thousand men, and I have three times that number. I give you my word of honor,&rdquo; said Napoleon, forgetting that his word of honor could carry no weight&mdash;&ldquo;I give you my word of honor that I have five hundred and thirty thousand men this side of the Vistula. The Turks will be of no use to you; they are worth nothing and have shown it by making peace with you. As for the Swedes&mdash;it is their fate to be governed by mad kings. Their king was insane and they changed him for another&mdash;Bernadotte, who promptly went mad&mdash;for no Swede would ally himself with Russia unless he were mad.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
