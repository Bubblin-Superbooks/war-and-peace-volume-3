<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When sent for by Count Ostermann, Rostóv, remembering that he had charged without orders, felt sure his commander was sending for him to punish him for breach of discipline. Ostermann&rsquo;s flattering words and promise of a reward should therefore have struck him all the more pleasantly, but he still felt that same vaguely disagreeable feeling of moral nausea. &ldquo;But what on earth is worrying me?&rdquo; he asked himself as he rode back from the general. &ldquo;Ilyín? No, he&rsquo;s safe. Have I disgraced myself in any way? No, that&rsquo;s not it.&rdquo; Something else, resembling remorse, tormented him. &ldquo;Yes, oh yes, that French officer with the dimple. And I remember how my arm paused when I raised it.&rdquo;</p><p>Rostóv saw the prisoners being led away and galloped after them to have a look at his Frenchman with the dimple on his chin.</p></div> </div>
