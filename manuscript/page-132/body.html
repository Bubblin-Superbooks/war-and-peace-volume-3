Let the others make mistakes now!&rdquo; said they, arguing that our retirement to Drissa was a most shameful reverse and an unbroken series of blunders. &ldquo;The more mistakes that are made the better. It will at any rate be understood all the sooner that things cannot go on like this. What is wanted is not some Barclay or other, but a man like Bennigsen, who made his mark in 1807, and to whom Napoleon himself did justice&mdash;a man whose authority would be willingly recognized, and Bennigsen is the only such man.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
