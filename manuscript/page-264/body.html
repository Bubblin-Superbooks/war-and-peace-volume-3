His coachman did not even ask whether he was to wait. He knew that when his master was at the Rostóvs&rsquo; he stayed till midnight. The Rostóvs&rsquo; footman rushed eagerly forward to help him off with his cloak and take his hat and stick. Pierre, from club habit, always left both hat and stick in the anteroom.</p></div> </div>
