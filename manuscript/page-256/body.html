<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Writing the words L&rsquo;Empereur Napol√©on in numbers, it appears that the sum of them is 666, and that Napoleon was therefore the beast foretold in the Apocalypse. Moreover, by applying the same system to the words quarante-deux, * which was the term allowed to the beast that &ldquo;spoke great things and blasphemies,&rdquo; the same number 666 was obtained; from which it followed that the limit fixed for Napoleon&rsquo;s power had come in the year 1812 when the French emperor was forty-two. This prophecy pleased Pierre very much and he often asked himself what would put an end to the power of the beast, that is, of Napoleon, and tried by the same system of using letters as numbers and adding them up, to find an answer to the question that engrossed him. He wrote the words L&rsquo;Empereur Alexandre, La nation russe and added up their numbers, but the sums were either more or less than 666.</p></div> </div>
