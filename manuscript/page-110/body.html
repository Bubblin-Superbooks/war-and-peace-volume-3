<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &ldquo;Why does Prince Andrew, who sees this, say nothing to me about his sister? Does he think me a scoundrel, or an old fool who, without any reason, keeps his own daughter at a distance and attaches this Frenchwoman to himself? He doesn&rsquo;t understand, so I must explain it, and he must hear me out,&rdquo; thought the old prince. And he began explaining why he could not put up with his daughter&rsquo;s unreasonable character.</p><p>&ldquo;If you ask me,&rdquo; said Prince Andrew, without looking up (he was censuring his father for the first time in his life), &ldquo;I did not wish to speak about it, but as you ask me I will give you my frank opinion. If there is any misunderstanding and discord between you and Mary, I can&rsquo;t blame her for it at all. I know how she loves and respects you.</p></div> </div>
