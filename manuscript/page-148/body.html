<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A Russian is self-assured just because he knows nothing and does not want to know anything, since he does not believe that anything can be known. The German&rsquo;s self-assurance is worst of all, stronger and more repulsive than any other, because he imagines that he knows the truth&mdash;science&mdash;which he himself has invented but which is for him the absolute truth.</p><p>Pfuel was evidently of that sort. He had a science&mdash;the theory of oblique movements deduced by him from the history of Frederick the Great&rsquo;s wars, and all he came across in the history of more recent warfare seemed to him absurd and barbarous&mdash;monstrous collisions in which so many blunders were committed by both sides that these wars could not be called wars, they did not accord with the theory, and therefore could not serve as material for science.</p></div> </div>
