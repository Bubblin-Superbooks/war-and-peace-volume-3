When one thinks who and what&mdash;what trash&mdash;can cause people misery!&rdquo; he said with a malignity that alarmed Princess Mary.</p><p>She understood that when speaking of &ldquo;trash&rdquo; he referred not only to Mademoiselle Bourienne, the cause of her misery, but also to the man who had ruined his own happiness.</p><p>&ldquo;Andrew! One thing I beg, I entreat of you!&rdquo; she said, touching his elbow and looking at him with eyes that shone through her tears. &ldquo;I understand you&rdquo; (she looked down). &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t imagine that sorrow is the work of men. Men are His tools.&rdquo; She looked a little above Prince Andrew&rsquo;s head with the confident, accustomed look with which one looks at the place where a familiar portrait hangs. &ldquo;Sorrow is sent by Him, not by men. Men are His instruments, they are not to blame.</p></div> </div>
