Why are you upset?&rdquo; asked Natásha, and she looked challengingly into Pierre&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Because I love you!&rdquo; was what he wanted to say, but he did not say it, and only blushed till the tears came, and lowered his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Because it is better for me to come less often... because... No, simply I have business....&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why? No, tell me!&rdquo; Natásha began resolutely and suddenly stopped.</p><p>They looked at each other with dismayed and embarrassed faces.
