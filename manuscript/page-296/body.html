A tradesman&rsquo;s wife was showing a rent in her shawl and telling how much the shawl had cost; another was saying that all silk goods had now got dear. The clerk who had rescued Pétya was talking to a functionary about the priests who were officiating that day with the bishop. The clerk several times used the word &ldquo;plenary&rdquo; (of the service), a word Pétya did not understand. Two young citizens were joking with some serf girls who were cracking nuts.
