Mary Hendríkhovna, a plump little blonde German, in a dressing jacket and nightcap, was sitting on a broad bench in the front corner. Her husband, the doctor, lay asleep behind her. Rostóv and Ilyín, on entering the room, were welcomed with merry shouts and laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;Dear me, how jolly we are!&rdquo; said Rostóv laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;And why do you stand there gaping?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What swells they are!
