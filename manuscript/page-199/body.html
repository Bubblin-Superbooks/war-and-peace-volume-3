Walk, march!&rdquo; came the order from in front.</p><p>And the hussars, passing along the line of troops on the left flank of our position, halted behind our Uhlans who were in the front line. To the right stood our infantry in a dense column: they were the reserve. Higher up the hill, on the very horizon, our guns were visible through the wonderfully clear air, brightly illuminated by slanting morning sunbeams. In front, beyond a hollow dale, could be seen the enemy&rsquo;s columns and guns. Our advanced line, already in action, could be heard briskly exchanging shots with the enemy in the dale.</p></div> </div>
