In these voluminous notes Toll suggested another scheme, totally different from Armfeldt&rsquo;s or Pfuel&rsquo;s plan of campaign. In answer to Toll, Paulucci suggested an advance and an attack, which, he urged, could alone extricate us from the present uncertainty and from the trap (as he called the Drissa camp) in which we were situated.</p><p>During all these discussions Pfuel and his interpreter, Wolzogen (his &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; in court relations), were silent. Pfuel only snorted contemptuously and turned away, to show that he would never demean himself by replying to such nonsense as he was now hearing.</p></div> </div>
