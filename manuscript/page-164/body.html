<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> And why do they all speak of a &lsquo;military genius&rsquo;? Is a man a genius who can order bread to be brought up at the right time and say who is to go to the right and who to the left? It is only because military men are invested with pomp and power and crowds of sychophants flatter power, attributing to it qualities of genius it does not possess. The best generals I have known were, on the contrary, stupid or absent-minded men. Bagrati√≥n was the best, Napoleon himself admitted that. And of Bonaparte himself! I remember his limited, self-satisfied face on the field of Austerlitz. Not only does a good army commander not need any special qualities, on the contrary he needs the absence of the highest and best human attributes&mdash;love, poetry, tenderness, and philosophic inquiring doubt.</p></div> </div>
