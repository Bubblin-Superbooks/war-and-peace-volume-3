<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>After all that Napoleon had said to him&mdash;those bursts of anger and the last dryly spoken words: &ldquo;I will detain you no longer, General; you shall receive my letter,&rdquo; Balashëv felt convinced that Napoleon would not wish to see him, and would even avoid another meeting with him&mdash;an insulted envoy&mdash;especially as he had witnessed his unseemly anger. But, to his surprise, Balashëv received, through Duroc, an invitation to dine with the Emperor that day.</p><p>Bessières, Caulaincourt, and Berthier were present at that dinner.</p><p>Napoleon met Balashëv cheerfully and amiably. He not only showed no sign of constraint or self-reproach on account of his outburst that morning, but, on the contrary, tried to reassure Balashëv. It was evident that he had long been convinced that it was impossible for him to make a mistake, and that in his perception whatever he did was right, not because it harmonized with any idea of right and wrong, but because he did it.</p></div> </div>
