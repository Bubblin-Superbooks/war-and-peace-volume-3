There were people not only in the square, but everywhere&mdash;on the slopes and on the roofs. As soon as Pétya found himself in the square he clearly heard the sound of bells and the joyous voices of the crowd that filled the whole Krémlin.</p><p>For a while the crowd was less dense, but suddenly all heads were bared, and everyone rushed forward in one direction. Pétya was being pressed so that he could scarcely breathe, and everybody shouted, &ldquo;Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!&rdquo; Pétya stood on tiptoe and pushed and pinched, but could see nothing except the people about him.</p></div> </div>
