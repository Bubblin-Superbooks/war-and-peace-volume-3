<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of them we find; and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears to us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance compared to the magnitude of the events, and by its impotence&mdash;apart from the cooperation of all the other coincident causes&mdash;to occasion the event. To us, the wish or objection of this or that French corporal to serve a second term appears as much a cause as Napoleon&rsquo;s refusal to withdraw his troops beyond the Vistula and to restore the duchy of Oldenburg; for had he not wished to serve, and had a second, a third, and a thousandth corporal and private also refused, there would have been so many less men in Napoleon&rsquo;s army and the war could not have occurred.</p></div> </div>
