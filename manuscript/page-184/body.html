A board was found, fixed on two saddles and covered with a horsecloth, a small samovar was produced and a cellaret and half a bottle of rum, and having asked Mary Hendríkhovna to preside, they all crowded round her. One offered her a clean handkerchief to wipe her charming hands, another spread a jacket under her little feet to keep them from the damp, another hung his coat over the window to keep out the draft, and yet another waved the flies off her husband&rsquo;s face, lest he should wake up.</p><p>&ldquo;Leave him alone,&rdquo; said Mary Hendríkhovna, smiling timidly and happily. &ldquo;He is sleeping well as it is, after a sleepless night.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
