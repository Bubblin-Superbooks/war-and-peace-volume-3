But a man should not and cannot forgive and forget,&rdquo; he replied, and though till that moment he had not been thinking of Kurágin, all his unexpended anger suddenly swelled up in his heart.</p><p>&ldquo;If Mary is already persuading me to forgive, it means that I ought long ago to have punished him,&rdquo; he thought. And giving her no further reply, he began thinking of the glad vindictive moment when he would meet Kurágin who he knew was now in the army.</p></div> </div>
