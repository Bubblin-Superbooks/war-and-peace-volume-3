On the way he came upon a bush, his gallant horse cleared it, and almost before he had righted himself in his saddle he saw that he would immediately overtake the enemy he had selected. That Frenchman, by his uniform an officer, was going at a gallop, crouching on his gray horse and urging it on with his saber. In another moment Rost贸v&rsquo;s horse dashed its breast against the hindquarters of the officer&rsquo;s horse, almost knocking it over, and at the same instant Rost贸v, without knowing why, raised his saber and struck the Frenchman with it.</p><p>The instant he had done this, all Rost贸v&rsquo;s animation vanished. The officer fell, not so much from the blow&mdash;which had but slightly cut his arm above the elbow&mdash;as from the shock to his horse and from fright.</p></div> </div>
