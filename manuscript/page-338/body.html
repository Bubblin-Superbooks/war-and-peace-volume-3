<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Everything came about fortuitously. The armies were divided at the commencement of the campaign. We tried to unite them, with the evident intention of giving battle and checking the enemy&rsquo;s advance, and by this effort to unite them while avoiding battle with a much stronger enemy, and necessarily withdrawing the armies at an acute angle&mdash;we led the French on to Smolénsk. But we withdrew at an acute angle not only because the French advanced between our two armies; the angle became still more acute and we withdrew still farther, because Barclay de Tolly was an unpopular foreigner disliked by Bagratión (who would come under his command), and Bagratión&mdash;being in command of the second army&mdash;tried to postpone joining up and coming under Barclay&rsquo;s command as long as he could.</p></div> </div>
