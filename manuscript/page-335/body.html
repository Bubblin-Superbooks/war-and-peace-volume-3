<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I said then that it would be so,&rdquo; quite forgetting that amid their innumerable conjectures many were to quite the contrary effect.</p><p>Conjectures as to Napoleon&rsquo;s awareness of the danger of extending his line, and (on the Russian side) as to luring the enemy into the depths of Russia, are evidently of that kind, and only by much straining can historians attribute such conceptions to Napoleon and his marshals, or such plans to the Russian commanders. All the facts are in flat contradiction to such conjectures. During the whole period of the war not only was there no wish on the Russian side to draw the French into the heart of the country, but from their first entry into Russia everything was done to stop them. And not only was Napoleon not afraid to extend his line, but he welcomed every step forward as a triumph and did not seek battle as eagerly as in former campaigns, but very lazily.</p></div> </div>
