<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &ldquo;In the first place, there must have been such a confusion and crowding on the dam that was being attacked that if Raévski did lead his sons there, it could have had no effect except perhaps on some dozen men nearest to him,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;the rest could not have seen how or with whom Raévski came onto the dam. And even those who did see it would not have been much stimulated by it, for what had they to do with Raévski&rsquo;s tender paternal feelings when their own skins were in danger? And besides, the fate of the Fatherland did not depend on whether they took the Saltánov dam or not, as we are told was the case at Thermopylae. So why should he have made such a sacrifice? And why expose his own children in the battle? I would not have taken my brother Pétya there, or even Ilyín, who&rsquo;s a stranger to me but a nice lad, but would have tried to put them somewhere under cover,&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
