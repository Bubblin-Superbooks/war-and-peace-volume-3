<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Balashëv found Davout seated on a barrel in the shed of a peasant&rsquo;s hut, writing&mdash;he was auditing accounts. Better quarters could have been found him, but Marshal Davout was one of those men who purposely put themselves in most depressing conditions to have a justification for being gloomy. For the same reason they are always hard at work and in a hurry. &ldquo;How can I think of the bright side of life when, as you see, I am sitting on a barrel and working in a dirty shed?&rdquo; the expression of his face seemed to say. The chief pleasure and necessity of such men, when they encounter anyone who shows animation, is to flaunt their own dreary, persistent activity. Davout allowed himself that pleasure when Balashëv was brought in.</p></div> </div>
