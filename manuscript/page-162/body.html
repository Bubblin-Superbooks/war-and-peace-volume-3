<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A thought that had long since and often occurred to him during his military activities&mdash;the idea that there is not and cannot be any science of war, and that therefore there can be no such thing as a military genius&mdash;now appeared to him an obvious truth. &ldquo;What theory and science is possible about a matter the conditions and circumstances of which are unknown and cannot be defined, especially when the strength of the acting forces cannot be ascertained? No one was or is able to foresee in what condition our or the enemy&rsquo;s armies will be in a day&rsquo;s time, and no one can gauge the force of this or that detachment. Sometimes&mdash;when there is not a coward at the front to shout, &lsquo;We are cut off!&rsquo; and start running, but a brave and jolly lad who shouts, &lsquo;Hurrah!&rsquo;&mdash;</p></div> </div>
