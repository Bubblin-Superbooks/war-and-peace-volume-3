<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The cause of the destruction of the French army in 1812 is clear to us now. No one will deny that that cause was, on the one hand, its advance into the heart of Russia late in the season without any preparation for a winter campaign and, on the other, the character given to the war by the burning of Russian towns and the hatred of the foe this aroused among the Russian people. But no one at the time foresaw (what now seems so evident) that this was the only way an army of eight hundred thousand men&mdash;the best in the world and led by the best general&mdash;could be destroyed in conflict with a raw army of half its numerical strength, and led by inexperienced commanders as the Russian army was.</p></div> </div>
