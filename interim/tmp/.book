  "page-9": "<p>From the close of the year 1811 intensified arming and concentrating of the forces of Western Europe began, and in 1812 these forces&mdash;millions of men, reckoning those transporting and feeding the army&mdash;moved from the west eastwards to the Russian frontier, toward which since 1811 Russian forces had been similarly drawn. On the twelfth of June, 1812, the forces of Western Europe crossed the Russian frontier and war began, that is, an event took place opposed to human reason and to human nature. Millions of men perpetrated against one another such innumerable crimes, frauds, treacheries, thefts, forgeries, issues of false money, burglaries, incendiarisms, and murders as in whole centuries are not recorded in the annals of all the law courts of the world, but which those who committed them did not at the time regard as being crimes.</p>",
  "page-10": "<p>What produced this extraordinary occurrence? What were its causes? The historians tell us with naïve assurance that its causes were the wrongs inflicted on the Duke of Oldenburg, the nonobservance of the Continental System, the ambition of Napoleon, the firmness of Alexander, the mistakes of the diplomatists, and so on.</p><p>Consequently, it would only have been necessary for Metternich, Rumyántsev, or Talleyrand, between a levee and an evening party, to have taken proper pains and written a more adroit note, or for Napoleon to have written to Alexander: &ldquo;My respected Brother, I consent to restore the duchy to the Duke of Oldenburg&rdquo;&mdash;and there would have been no war.</p><p>We can understand that the matter seemed like that to contemporaries. It naturally seemed to Napoleon that the war was caused by England&rsquo;s intrigues (as in fact he said on the island of St. Helena).</p>",
  "page-11": "<p> It naturally seemed to members of the English Parliament that the cause of the war was Napoleon&rsquo;s ambition; to the Duke of Oldenburg, that the cause of the war was the violence done to him; to businessmen that the cause of the war was the Continental System which was ruining Europe; to the generals and old soldiers that the chief reason for the war was the necessity of giving them employment; to the legitimists of that day that it was the need of re-establishing les bons principes, and to the diplomatists of that time that it all resulted from the fact that the alliance between Russia and Austria in 1809 had not been sufficiently well concealed from Napoleon, and from the awkward wording of Memorandum No. 178. It is natural that these and a countless and infinite quantity of other reasons, the number depending on the endless diversity of points of view, presented themselves to the men of that day;</p>",
  "page-12": "<p> but to us, to posterity who view the thing that happened in all its magnitude and perceive its plain and terrible meaning, these causes seem insufficient. To us it is incomprehensible that millions of Christian men killed and tortured each other either because Napoleon was ambitious or Alexander was firm, or because England&rsquo;s policy was astute or the Duke of Oldenburg wronged. We cannot grasp what connection such circumstances have with the actual fact of slaughter and violence: why because the Duke was wronged, thousands of men from the other side of Europe killed and ruined the people of Smolénsk and Moscow and were killed by them.</p><p>To us, their descendants, who are not historians and are not carried away by the process of research and can therefore regard the event with unclouded common sense, an incalculable number of causes present themselves.</p>",
  "page-13": "<p> The deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of them we find; and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears to us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance compared to the magnitude of the events, and by its impotence&mdash;apart from the cooperation of all the other coincident causes&mdash;to occasion the event. To us, the wish or objection of this or that French corporal to serve a second term appears as much a cause as Napoleon&rsquo;s refusal to withdraw his troops beyond the Vistula and to restore the duchy of Oldenburg; for had he not wished to serve, and had a second, a third, and a thousandth corporal and private also refused, there would have been so many less men in Napoleon&rsquo;s army and the war could not have occurred.</p>",
  "page-14": "<p>Had Napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw beyond the Vistula, and not ordered his troops to advance, there would have been no war; but had all his sergeants objected to serving a second term then also there could have been no war. Nor could there have been a war had there been no English intrigues and no Duke of Oldenburg, and had Alexander not felt insulted, and had there not been an autocratic government in Russia, or a Revolution in France and a subsequent dictatorship and Empire, or all the things that produced the French Revolution, and so on. Without each of these causes nothing could have happened. So all these causes&mdash;myriads of causes&mdash;coincided to bring it about. And so there was no one cause for that occurrence, but it had to occur because it had to.</p>",
  "page-15": "<p> Millions of men, renouncing their human feelings and reason, had to go from west to east to slay their fellows, just as some centuries previously hordes of men had come from the east to the west, slaying their fellows.</p><p>The actions of Napoleon and Alexander, on whose words the event seemed to hang, were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who was drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription. This could not be otherwise, for in order that the will of Napoleon and Alexander (on whom the event seemed to depend) should be carried out, the concurrence of innumerable circumstances was needed without anyone of which the event could not have taken place. It was necessary that millions of men in whose hands lay the real power&mdash;the soldiers who fired, or transported provisions and guns&mdash;</p>",
  "page-16": "<p>should consent to carry out the will of these weak individuals, and should have been induced to do so by an infinite number of diverse and complex causes.</p><p>We are forced to fall back on fatalism as an explanation of irrational events (that is to say, events the reasonableness of which we do not understand). The more we try to explain such events in history reasonably, the more unreasonable and incomprehensible do they become to us.</p><p>Each man lives for himself, using his freedom to attain his personal aims, and feels with his whole being that he can now do or abstain from doing this or that action; but as soon as he has done it, that action performed at a certain moment in time becomes irrevocable and belongs to history, in which it has not a free but a predestined significance.</p>",
  "page-17": "<p>There are two sides to the life of every man, his individual life, which is the more free the more abstract its interests, and his elemental hive life in which he inevitably obeys laws laid down for him.</p><p>Man lives consciously for himself, but is an unconscious instrument in the attainment of the historic, universal, aims of humanity. A deed done is irrevocable, and its result coinciding in time with the actions of millions of other men assumes an historic significance. The higher a man stands on the social ladder, the more people he is connected with and the more power he has over others, the more evident is the predestination and inevitability of his every action.</p><p>&ldquo;The king&rsquo;s heart is in the hands of the Lord.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-18": "<p>A king is history&rsquo;s slave.</p><p>History, that is, the unconscious, general, hive life of mankind, uses every moment of the life of kings as a tool for its own purposes.</p><p>Though Napoleon at that time, in 1812, was more convinced than ever that it depended on him, verser (ou ne pas verser) le sang de ses peuples *&mdash;as Alexander expressed it in the last letter he wrote him&mdash;he had never been so much in the grip of inevitable laws, which compelled him, while thinking that he was acting on his own volition, to perform for the hive life&mdash;that is to say, for history&mdash;whatever had to be performed.</p>",
  "page-19": "<p>The people of the west moved eastwards to slay their fellow men, and by the law of coincidence thousands of minute causes fitted in and co-ordinated to produce that movement and war: reproaches for the nonobservance of the Continental System, the Duke of Oldenburg&rsquo;s wrongs, the movement of troops into Prussia&mdash;undertaken (as it seemed to Napoleon) only for the purpose of securing an armed peace, the French Emperor&rsquo;s love and habit of war coinciding with his people&rsquo;s inclinations, allurement by the grandeur of the preparations, and the expenditure on those preparations and the need of obtaining advantages to compensate for that expenditure, the intoxicating honors he received in Dresden, the diplomatic negotiations which, in the opinion of contemporaries, were carried on with a sincere desire to attain peace, but which only wounded the self-love of both sides, and millions of other causes that adapted themselves to the event that was happening or coincided with it.</p>",
  "page-20": "<p>When an apple has ripened and falls, why does it fall? Because of its attraction to the earth, because its stalk withers, because it is dried by the sun, because it grows heavier, because the wind shakes it, or because the boy standing below wants to eat it?</p><p>Nothing is the cause. All this is only the coincidence of conditions in which all vital organic and elemental events occur. And the botanist who finds that the apple falls because the cellular tissue decays and so forth is equally right with the child who stands under the tree and says the apple fell because he wanted to eat it and prayed for it. Equally right or wrong is he who says that Napoleon went to Moscow because he wanted to, and perished because Alexander desired his destruction, and he who says that an undermined hill weighing a million tons fell because the last navvy struck it for the last time with his mattock.</p>",
  "page-21": "<p> In historic events the so-called great men are labels giving names to events, and like labels they have but the smallest connection with the event itself.</p><p>Every act of theirs, which appears to them an act of their own will, is in an historical sense involuntary and is related to the whole course of history and predestined from eternity.</p>",
  "page-22": "<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>",
  "page-23": "<p>On the twenty-ninth of May Napoleon left Dresden, where he had spent three weeks surrounded by a court that included princes, dukes, kings, and even an emperor. Before leaving, Napoleon showed favor to the emperor, kings, and princes who had deserved it, reprimanded the kings and princes with whom he was dissatisfied, presented pearls and diamonds of his own&mdash;that is, which he had taken from other kings&mdash;to the Empress of Austria, and having, as his historian tells us, tenderly embraced the Empress Marie Louise&mdash;who regarded him as her husband, though he had left another wife in Paris&mdash;left her grieved by the parting which she seemed hardly able to bear. Though the diplomatists still firmly believed in the possibility of peace and worked zealously to that end, and though the Emperor Napoleon himself wrote a letter to Alexander, calling him Monsieur mon frère, and sincerely assured him that he did not want war and would always love and honor him&mdash;</p>",
  "page-24": "<p>yet he set off to join his army, and at every station gave fresh orders to accelerate the movement of his troops from west to east. He went in a traveling coach with six horses, surrounded by pages, aides-de-camp, and an escort, along the road to Posen, Thorn, Danzig, and Königsberg. At each of these towns thousands of people met him with excitement and enthusiasm.</p><p>The army was moving from west to east, and relays of six horses carried him in the same direction. On the tenth of June, * coming up with the army, he spent the night in apartments prepared for him on the estate of a Polish count in the Vilkavisski forest.</p>",
  "page-25": "<p>Next day, overtaking the army, he went in a carriage to the Niemen, and, changing into a Polish uniform, he drove to the riverbank in order to select a place for the crossing.</p><p>Seeing, on the other side, some Cossacks (les Cosaques) and the wide-spreading steppes in the midst of which lay the holy city of Moscow (Moscou, la ville sainte), the capital of a realm such as the Scythia into which Alexander the Great had marched&mdash;Napoleon unexpectedly, and contrary alike to strategic and diplomatic considerations, ordered an advance, and the next day his army began to cross the Niemen.</p><p>Early in the morning of the twelfth of June he came out of his tent, which was pitched that day on the steep left bank of the Niemen, and looked through a spyglass at the streams of his troops pouring out of the Vilkavisski forest and flowing over the three bridges thrown across the river.</p>",
  "page-26": "<p> The troops, knowing of the Emperor&rsquo;s presence, were on the lookout for him, and when they caught sight of a figure in an overcoat and a cocked hat standing apart from his suite in front of his tent on the hill, they threw up their caps and shouted: &ldquo;Vive l&rsquo;Empereur!&rdquo; and one after another poured in a ceaseless stream out of the vast forest that had concealed them and, separating, flowed on and on by the three bridges to the other side.</p><p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll go into action. Oh, when he takes it in hand himself, things get hot... by heaven!... There he is!... Vive l&rsquo;Empereur! So these are the steppes of Asia! It&rsquo;s a nasty country all the same. Au revoir, Beauché; I&rsquo;ll keep the best palace in Moscow for you! Au revoir. Good luck!... Did you see the Emperor? Vive l&rsquo;Empereur!...</p>",
  "page-27": "<p> preur!&mdash;If they make me Governor of India, Gérard, I&rsquo;ll make you Minister of Kashmir&mdash;that&rsquo;s settled. Vive l&rsquo;Empereur! Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! The Cossacks&mdash;those rascals&mdash;see how they run! Vive l&rsquo;Empereur! There he is, do you see him? I&rsquo;ve seen him twice, as I see you now. The little corporal... I saw him give the cross to one of the veterans.... Vive l&rsquo;Empereur!&rdquo; came the voices of men, old and young, of most diverse characters and social positions. On the faces of all was one common expression of joy at the commencement of the long-expected campaign and of rapture and devotion to the man in the gray coat who was standing on the hill.</p><p>On the thirteenth of June a rather small, thoroughbred Arab horse was brought to Napoleon.</p>",
  "page-28": "<p> He mounted it and rode at a gallop to one of the bridges over the Niemen, deafened continually by incessant and rapturous acclamations which he evidently endured only because it was impossible to forbid the soldiers to express their love of him by such shouting, but the shouting which accompanied him everywhere disturbed him and distracted him from the military cares that had occupied him from the time he joined the army. He rode across one of the swaying pontoon bridges to the farther side, turned sharply to the left, and galloped in the direction of Kóvno, preceded by enraptured, mounted chasseurs of the Guard who, breathless with delight, galloped ahead to clear a path for him through the troops. On reaching the broad river Víliya, he stopped near a regiment of Polish Uhlans stationed by the river.</p>",
  "page-29": "<p>&ldquo;Vivat!&rdquo; shouted the Poles, ecstatically, breaking their ranks and pressing against one another to see him.</p><p>Napoleon looked up and down the river, dismounted, and sat down on a log that lay on the bank. At a mute sign from him, a telescope was handed him which he rested on the back of a happy page who had run up to him, and he gazed at the opposite bank. Then he became absorbed in a map laid out on the logs. Without lifting his head he said something, and two of his aides-de-camp galloped off to the Polish Uhlans.</p><p>&ldquo;What? What did he say?&rdquo; was heard in the ranks of the Polish Uhlans when one of the aides-de-camp rode up to them.</p>",
  "page-30": "<p>The order was to find a ford and to cross the river. The colonel of the Polish Uhlans, a handsome old man, flushed and, fumbling in his speech from excitement, asked the aide-de-camp whether he would be permitted to swim the river with his Uhlans instead of seeking a ford. In evident fear of refusal, like a boy asking for permission to get on a horse, he begged to be allowed to swim across the river before the Emperor&rsquo;s eyes. The aide-de-camp replied that probably the Emperor would not be displeased at this excess of zeal.</p><p>As soon as the aide-de-camp had said this, the old mustached officer, with happy face and sparkling eyes, raised his saber, shouted &ldquo;Vivat!&rdquo; and, commanding the Uhlans to follow him, spurred his horse and galloped into the river.</p>",
  "page-31": "<p> He gave an angry thrust to his horse, which had grown restive under him, and plunged into the water, heading for the deepest part where the current was swift. Hundreds of Uhlans galloped in after him. It was cold and uncanny in the rapid current in the middle of the stream, and the Uhlans caught hold of one another as they fell off their horses. Some of the horses were drowned and some of the men; the others tried to swim on, some in the saddle and some clinging to their horses&rsquo; manes. They tried to make their way forward to the opposite bank and, though there was a ford one third of a mile away, were proud that they were swimming and drowning in this river under the eyes of the man who sat on the log and was not even looking at what they were doing.</p>",
  "page-32": "<p> When the aide-de-camp, having returned and choosing an opportune moment, ventured to draw the Emperor&rsquo;s attention to the devotion of the Poles to his person, the little man in the gray overcoat got up and, having summoned Berthier, began pacing up and down the bank with him, giving him instructions and occasionally glancing disapprovingly at the drowning Uhlans who distracted his attention.</p><p>For him it was no new conviction that his presence in any part of the world, from Africa to the steppes of Muscovy alike, was enough to dumfound people and impel them to insane self-oblivion. He called for his horse and rode to his quarters.</p><p>Some forty Uhlans were drowned in the river, though boats were sent to their assistance. The majority struggled back to the bank from which they had started.</p>",
  "page-33": "<p> The colonel and some of his men got across and with difficulty clambered out on the further bank. And as soon as they had got out, in their soaked and streaming clothes, they shouted &ldquo;Vivat!&rdquo; and looked ecstatically at the spot where Napoleon had been but where he no longer was and at that moment considered themselves happy.</p><p>That evening, between issuing one order that the forged Russian paper money prepared for use in Russia should be delivered as quickly as possible and another that a Saxon should be shot, on whom a letter containing information about the orders to the French army had been found, Napoleon also gave instructions that the Polish colonel who had needlessly plunged into the river should be enrolled in the Légion d&rsquo;honneur of which Napoleon was himself the head.</p>",

  "page-35": "<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>",
  "page-36": "<p>The Emperor of Russia had, meanwhile, been in Vílna for more than a month, reviewing troops and holding maneuvers. Nothing was ready for the war that everyone expected and to prepare for which the Emperor had come from Petersburg. There was no general plan of action. The vacillation between the various plans that were proposed had even increased after the Emperor had been at headquarters for a month. Each of the three armies had its own commander in chief, but there was no supreme commander of all the forces, and the Emperor did not assume that responsibility himself.</p><p>The longer the Emperor remained in Vílna the less did everybody&mdash;tired of waiting&mdash;prepare for the war. All the efforts of those who surrounded the sovereign seemed directed merely to making him spend his time pleasantly and forget that war was impending.</p>",
  "page-37": "<p>In June, after many balls and fetes given by the Polish magnates, by the courtiers, and by the Emperor himself, it occurred to one of the Polish aides-de-camp in attendance that a dinner and ball should be given for the Emperor by his aides-de-camp. This idea was eagerly received. The Emperor gave his consent. The aides-de-camp collected money by subscription. The lady who was thought to be most pleasing to the Emperor was invited to act as hostess. Count Bennigsen, being a landowner in the Vílna province, offered his country house for the fete, and the thirteenth of June was fixed for a ball, dinner, regatta, and fireworks at Zakret, Count Bennigsen&rsquo;s country seat.</p>",
  "page-38": "<p>The very day that Napoleon issued the order to cross the Niemen, and his vanguard, driving off the Cossacks, crossed the Russian frontier, Alexander spent the evening at the entertainment given by his aides-de-camp at Bennigsen&rsquo;s country house.</p><p>It was a gay and brilliant fete. Connoisseurs of such matters declared that rarely had so many beautiful women been assembled in one place. Countess Bezúkhova was present among other Russian ladies who had followed the sovereign from Petersburg to Vílna and eclipsed the refined Polish ladies by her massive, so-called Russian type of beauty. The Emperor noticed her and honored her with a dance.</p><p>Borís Drubetskóy, having left his wife in Moscow and being for the present en garçon (as he phrased it), was also there and, though not an aide-de-camp, had subscribed a large sum toward the expenses.</p>",
  "page-39": "<p> Borís was now a rich man who had risen to high honors and no longer sought patronage but stood on an equal footing with the highest of those of his own age. He was meeting Hélène in Vílna after not having seen her for a long time and did not recall the past, but as Hélène was enjoying the favors of a very important personage and Borís had only recently married, they met as good friends of long standing.</p><p>At midnight dancing was still going on. Hélène, not having a suitable partner, herself offered to dance the mazurka with Borís. They were the third couple. Borís, coolly looking at Hélène&rsquo;s dazzling bare shoulders which emerged from a dark, gold-embroidered, gauze gown, talked to her of old acquaintances and at the same time, unaware of it himself and unnoticed by others, never for an instant ceased to observe the Emperor who was in the same room.</p>",
  "page-40": "<p> The Emperor was not dancing, he stood in the doorway, stopping now one pair and now another with gracious words which he alone knew how to utter.</p><p>As the mazurka began, Borís saw that Adjutant General Balashëv, one of those in closest attendance on the Emperor, went up to him and contrary to court etiquette stood near him while he was talking to a Polish lady. Having finished speaking to her, the Emperor looked inquiringly at Balashëv and, evidently understanding that he only acted thus because there were important reasons for so doing, nodded slightly to the lady and turned to him. Hardly had Balashëv begun to speak before a look of amazement appeared on the Emperor&rsquo;s face. He took Balashëv by the arm and crossed the room with him, unconsciously clearing a path seven yards wide as the people on both sides made way for him.</p>",
  "page-41": "<p> Borís noticed Arakchéev&rsquo;s excited face when the sovereign went out with Balashëv. Arakchéev looked at the Emperor from under his brow and, sniffing with his red nose, stepped forward from the crowd as if expecting the Emperor to address him. (Borís understood that Arakchéev envied Balashëv and was displeased that evidently important news had reached the Emperor otherwise than through himself.)</p><p>But the Emperor and Balashëv passed out into the illuminated garden without noticing Arakchéev who, holding his sword and glancing wrathfully around, followed some twenty paces behind them.</p><p>All the time Borís was going through the figures of the mazurka, he was worried by the question of what news Balashëv had brought and how he could find it out before others.</p>",
  "page-42": "<p> In the figure in which he had to choose two ladies, he whispered to Hélène that he meant to choose Countess Potocka who, he thought, had gone out onto the veranda, and glided over the parquet to the door opening into the garden, where, seeing Balashëv and the Emperor returning to the veranda, he stood still. They were moving toward the door. Borís, fluttering as if he had not had time to withdraw, respectfully pressed close to the doorpost with bowed head.</p><p>The Emperor, with the agitation of one who has been personally affronted, was finishing with these words:</p><p>&ldquo;To enter Russia without declaring war! I will not make peace as long as a single armed enemy remains in my country!&rdquo; It seemed to Borís that it gave the Emperor pleasure to utter these words.</p>",
  "page-43": "<p> He was satisfied with the form in which he had expressed his thoughts, but displeased that Borís had overheard it.</p><p>&ldquo;Let no one know of it!&rdquo; the Emperor added with a frown.</p><p>Borís understood that this was meant for him and, closing his eyes, slightly bowed his head. The Emperor re-entered the ballroom and remained there about another half-hour.</p><p>Borís was thus the first to learn the news that the French army had crossed the Niemen and, thanks to this, was able to show certain important personages that much that was concealed from others was usually known to him, and by this means he rose higher in their estimation.</p>",
  "page-44": "<p>The unexpected news of the French having crossed the Niemen was particularly startling after a month of unfulfilled expectations, and at a ball. On first receiving the news, under the influence of indignation and resentment the Emperor had found a phrase that pleased him, fully expressed his feelings, and has since become famous. On returning home at two o&rsquo;clock that night he sent for his secretary, Shishkóv, and told him to write an order to the troops and a rescript to Field Marshal Prince Saltykóv, in which he insisted on the words being inserted that he would not make peace so long as a single armed Frenchman remained on Russian soil.</p><p>Next day the following letter was sent to Napoleon:</p>",
  "page-45": "<p>Monsieur mon frère,</p><p>Yesterday I learned that, despite the loyalty with which I have kept my engagements with Your Majesty, your troops have crossed the Russian frontier, and I have this moment received from Petersburg a note, in which Count Lauriston informs me, as a reason for this aggression, that Your Majesty has considered yourself to be in a state of war with me from the time Prince Kurákin asked for his passports. The reasons on which the Duc de Bassano based his refusal to deliver them to him would never have led me to suppose that that could serve as a pretext for aggression. In fact, the ambassador, as he himself has declared, was never authorized to make that demand, and as soon as I was informed of it I let him know how much I disapproved of it and ordered him to remain at his post.</p>",
  "page-46": "<p> If Your Majesty does not intend to shed the blood of our peoples for such a misunderstanding, and consents to withdraw your troops from Russian territory, I will regard what has passed as not having occurred and an understanding between us will be possible. In the contrary case, Your Majesty, I shall see myself forced to repel an attack that nothing on my part has provoked. It still depends on Your Majesty to preserve humanity from the calamity of another war.</p><p>I am, etc.,</p><p>(signed) Alexander</p>",
  "page-47": "<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>",
  "page-48": "<p>At two in the morning of the fourteenth of June, the Emperor, having sent for Balashëv and read him his letter to Napoleon, ordered him to take it and hand it personally to the French Emperor. When dispatching Balashëv, the Emperor repeated to him the words that he would not make peace so long as a single armed enemy remained on Russian soil and told him to transmit those words to Napoleon. Alexander did not insert them in his letter to Napoleon, because with his characteristic tact he felt it would be injudicious to use them at a moment when a last attempt at reconciliation was being made, but he definitely instructed Balashëv to repeat them personally to Napoleon.</p><p>Having set off in the small hours of the fourteenth, accompanied by a bugler and two Cossacks, Balashëv reached the French outposts at the village of Rykónty, on the Russian side of the Niemen, by dawn. There he was stopped by French cavalry sentinels.</p>",
  "page-49": "<p>A French noncommissioned officer of hussars, in crimson uniform and a shaggy cap, shouted to the approaching Balashëv to halt. Balashëv did not do so at once, but continued to advance along the road at a walking pace.</p><p>The noncommissioned officer frowned and, muttering words of abuse, advanced his horse&rsquo;s chest against Balashëv, put his hand to his saber, and shouted rudely at the Russian general, asking: was he deaf that he did not do as he was told? Balashëv mentioned who he was. The noncommissioned officer began talking with his comrades about regimental matters without looking at the Russian general.</p><p>After living at the seat of the highest authority and power, after conversing with the Emperor less than three hours before, and in general being accustomed to the respect due to his rank in the service, Balashëv found it very strange here on Russian soil to encounter this hostile, and still more this disrespectful, application of brute force to himself.</p>",
  "page-50": "<p>The sun was only just appearing from behind the clouds, the air was fresh and dewy. A herd of cattle was being driven along the road from the village, and over the fields the larks rose trilling, one after another, like bubbles rising in water.</p><p>Balashëv looked around him, awaiting the arrival of an officer from the village. The Russian Cossacks and bugler and the French hussars looked silently at one another from time to time.</p><p>A French colonel of hussars, who had evidently just left his bed, came riding from the village on a handsome sleek gray horse, accompanied by two hussars. The officer, the soldiers, and their horses all looked smart and well kept.</p>",
  "page-51": "<p>It was that first period of a campaign when troops are still in full trim, almost like that of peacetime maneuvers, but with a shade of martial swagger in their clothes, and a touch of the gaiety and spirit of enterprise which always accompany the opening of a campaign.</p><p>The French colonel with difficulty repressed a yawn, but was polite and evidently understood Balashëv&rsquo;s importance. He led him past his soldiers and behind the outposts and told him that his wish to be presented to the Emperor would most likely be satisfied immediately, as the Emperor&rsquo;s quarters were, he believed, not far off.</p><p>They rode through the village of Rykónty, past tethered French hussar horses, past sentinels and men who saluted their colonel and stared with curiosity at a Russian uniform, and came out at the other end of the village.</p>",
  "page-52": "<p> The colonel said that the commander of the division was a mile and a quarter away and would receive Balashëv and conduct him to his destination.</p><p>The sun had by now risen and shone gaily on the bright verdure.</p><p>They had hardly ridden up a hill, past a tavern, before they saw a group of horsemen coming toward them. In front of the group, on a black horse with trappings that glittered in the sun, rode a tall man with plumes in his hat and black hair curling down to his shoulders. He wore a red mantle, and stretched his long legs forward in French fashion. This man rode toward Balashëv at a gallop, his plumes flowing and his gems and gold lace glittering in the bright June sunshine.</p>",
  "page-53": "<p>Balashëv was only two horses&rsquo; length from the equestrian with the bracelets, plumes, necklaces, and gold embroidery, who was galloping toward him with a theatrically solemn countenance, when Julner, the French colonel, whispered respectfully: &ldquo;The King of Naples!&rdquo; It was, in fact, Murat, now called &ldquo;King of Naples.&rdquo; Though it was quite incomprehensible why he should be King of Naples, he was called so, and was himself convinced that he was so, and therefore assumed a more solemn and important air than formerly. He was so sure that he really was the King of Naples that when, on the eve of his departure from that city, while walking through the streets with his wife, some Italians called out to him: &ldquo;Viva il re!&rdquo; * he turned to his wife with a pensive smile and said: &ldquo;Poor fellows, they don&rsquo;t know that I am leaving them tomorrow!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-54": "<p>But though he firmly believed himself to be King of Naples and pitied the grief felt by the subjects he was abandoning, latterly, after he had been ordered to return to military service&mdash;and especially since his last interview with Napoleon in Danzig, when his august brother-in-law had told him: &ldquo;I made you King that you should reign in my way, but not in yours!&rdquo;&mdash;he had cheerfully taken up his familiar business, and&mdash;like a well-fed but not overfat horse that feels himself in harness and grows skittish between the shafts&mdash;he dressed up in clothes as variegated and expensive as possible, and gaily and contentedly galloped along the roads of Poland, without himself knowing why or whither.</p>",
  "page-55": "<p>On seeing the Russian general he threw back his head, with its long hair curling to his shoulders, in a majestically royal manner, and looked inquiringly at the French colonel. The colonel respectfully informed His Majesty of Balashëv&rsquo;s mission, whose name he could not pronounce.</p><p>&ldquo;De Bal-machève!&rdquo; said the King (overcoming by his assurance the difficulty that had presented itself to the colonel). &ldquo;Charmed to make your acquaintance, General!&rdquo; he added, with a gesture of kingly condescension.</p><p>As soon as the King began to speak loud and fast his royal dignity instantly forsook him, and without noticing it he passed into his natural tone of good-natured familiarity. He laid his hand on the withers of Balashëv&rsquo;s horse and said:</p>",
  "page-56": "<p>&ldquo;Well, General, it all looks like war,&rdquo; as if regretting a circumstance of which he was unable to judge.</p><p>&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; replied Balashëv, &ldquo;my master, the Emperor, does not desire war and as Your Majesty sees...&rdquo; said Balashëv, using the words Your Majesty at every opportunity, with the affectation unavoidable in frequently addressing one to whom the title was still a novelty.</p><p>Murat&rsquo;s face beamed with stupid satisfaction as he listened to &ldquo;Monsieur de Bal-machève.&rdquo; But royauté oblige! * and he felt it incumbent on him, as a king and an ally, to confer on state affairs with Alexander&rsquo;s envoy. He dismounted, took Balashëv&rsquo;s arm, and moving a few steps away from his suite, which waited respectfully, began to pace up and down with him, trying to speak significantly.</p>",
  "page-57": "<p> He referred to the fact that the Emperor Napoleon had resented the demand that he should withdraw his troops from Prussia, especially when that demand became generally known and the dignity of France was thereby offended.</p><p>Balashëv replied that there was &ldquo;nothing offensive in the demand, because...&rdquo; but Murat interrupted him.</p><p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t consider the Emperor Alexander the aggressor?&rdquo; he asked unexpectedly, with a kindly and foolish smile.</p><p>Balashëv told him why he considered Napoleon to be the originator of the war.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear general!&rdquo; Murat again interrupted him, &ldquo;with all my heart I wish the Emperors may arrange the affair between them, and that the war begun by no wish of mine may finish as quickly as possible!&rdquo; said he, in the tone of a servant who wants to remain good friends with another despite a quarrel between their masters.</p>",
  "page-58": "<p>And he went on to inquiries about the Grand Duke and the state of his health, and to reminiscences of the gay and amusing times he had spent with him in Naples. Then suddenly, as if remembering his royal dignity, Murat solemnly drew himself up, assumed the pose in which he had stood at his coronation, and, waving his right arm, said:</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t detain you longer, General. I wish success to your mission,&rdquo; and with his embroidered red mantle, his flowing feathers, and his glittering ornaments, he rejoined his suite who were respectfully awaiting him.</p><p>Balashëv rode on, supposing from Murat&rsquo;s words that he would very soon be brought before Napoleon himself. But instead of that, at the next village the sentinels of Davout&rsquo;s infantry corps detained him as the pickets of the vanguard had done, and an adjutant of the corps commander, who was fetched, conducted him into the village to Marshal Davout.</p>",
  "page-59": "<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>",
  "page-60": "<p>Davout was to Napoleon what Arakchéev was to Alexander&mdash;though not a coward like Arakchéev, he was as precise, as cruel, and as unable to express his devotion to his monarch except by cruelty.</p><p>In the organism of states such men are necessary, as wolves are necessary in the organism of nature, and they always exist, always appear and hold their own, however incongruous their presence and their proximity to the head of the government may be. This inevitability alone can explain how the cruel Arakchéev, who tore out a grenadier&rsquo;s mustache with his own hands, whose weak nerves rendered him unable to face danger, and who was neither an educated man nor a courtier, was able to maintain his powerful position with Alexander, whose own character was chivalrous, noble, and gentle.</p>",
  "page-61": "<p>Balashëv found Davout seated on a barrel in the shed of a peasant&rsquo;s hut, writing&mdash;he was auditing accounts. Better quarters could have been found him, but Marshal Davout was one of those men who purposely put themselves in most depressing conditions to have a justification for being gloomy. For the same reason they are always hard at work and in a hurry. &ldquo;How can I think of the bright side of life when, as you see, I am sitting on a barrel and working in a dirty shed?&rdquo; the expression of his face seemed to say. The chief pleasure and necessity of such men, when they encounter anyone who shows animation, is to flaunt their own dreary, persistent activity. Davout allowed himself that pleasure when Balashëv was brought in.</p>",
  "page-62": "<p> He became still more absorbed in his task when the Russian general entered, and after glancing over his spectacles at Balashëv&rsquo;s face, which was animated by the beauty of the morning and by his talk with Murat, he did not rise or even stir, but scowled still more and sneered malevolently.</p><p>When he noticed in Balashëv&rsquo;s face the disagreeable impression this reception produced, Davout raised his head and coldly asked what he wanted.</p><p>Thinking he could have been received in such a manner only because Davout did not know that he was adjutant general to the Emperor Alexander and even his envoy to Napoleon, Balashëv hastened to inform him of his rank and mission. Contrary to his expectation, Davout, after hearing him, became still surlier and ruder.</p>",
  "page-63": "<p>&ldquo;Where is your dispatch?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;Give it to me. I will send it to the Emperor.&rdquo;</p><p>Balashëv replied that he had been ordered to hand it personally to the Emperor.</p><p>&ldquo;Your Emperor&rsquo;s orders are obeyed in your army, but here,&rdquo; said Davout, &ldquo;you must do as you&rsquo;re told.&rdquo;</p><p>And, as if to make the Russian general still more conscious of his dependence on brute force, Davout sent an adjutant to call the officer on duty.</p><p>Balashëv took out the packet containing the Emperor&rsquo;s letter and laid it on the table (made of a door with its hinges still hanging on it, laid across two barrels). Davout took the packet and read the inscription.</p>",
  "page-64": "<p>&ldquo;You are perfectly at liberty to treat me with respect or not,&rdquo; protested Balashëv, &ldquo;but permit me to observe that I have the honor to be adjutant general to His Majesty....&rdquo;</p><p>Davout glanced at him silently and plainly derived pleasure from the signs of agitation and confusion which appeared on Balashëv&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;You will be treated as is fitting,&rdquo; said he and, putting the packet in his pocket, left the shed.</p><p>A minute later the marshal&rsquo;s adjutant, de Castrès, came in and conducted Balashëv to the quarters assigned him.</p><p>That day he dined with the marshal, at the same board on the barrels.</p>",
  "page-65": "<p>Next day Davout rode out early and, after asking Balashëv to come to him, peremptorily requested him to remain there, to move on with the baggage train should orders come for it to move, and to talk to no one except Monsieur de Castrès.</p><p>After four days of solitude, ennui, and consciousness of his impotence and insignificance&mdash;particularly acute by contrast with the sphere of power in which he had so lately moved&mdash;and after several marches with the marshal&rsquo;s baggage and the French army, which occupied the whole district, Balashëv was brought to Vílna&mdash;now occupied by the French&mdash;through the very gate by which he had left it four days previously.</p>",
  "page-66": "<p>Next day the imperial gentleman-in-waiting, the Comte de Turenne, came to Balashëv and informed him of the Emperor Napoleon&rsquo;s wish to honor him with an audience.</p><p>Four days before, sentinels of the Preobrazhénsk regiment had stood in front of the house to which Balashëv was conducted, and now two French grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front and with shaggy caps on their heads, and an escort of hussars and Uhlans and a brilliant suite of aides-de-camp, pages, and generals, who were waiting for Napoleon to come out, were standing at the porch, round his saddle horse and his Mameluke, Rustan. Napoleon received Balashëv in the very house in Vílna from which Alexander had dispatched him on his mission.</p>",
  "page-67": "<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>",
  "page-68": "<p>Though Balashëv was used to imperial pomp, he was amazed at the luxury and magnificence of Napoleon&rsquo;s court.</p><p>The Comte de Turenne showed him into a big reception room where many generals, gentlemen-in-waiting, and Polish magnates&mdash;several of whom Balashëv had seen at the court of the Emperor of Russia&mdash;were waiting. Duroc said that Napoleon would receive the Russian general before going for his ride.</p><p>After some minutes, the gentleman-in-waiting who was on duty came into the great reception room and, bowing politely, asked Balashëv to follow him.</p><p>Balashëv went into a small reception room, one door of which led into a study, the very one from which the Russian Emperor had dispatched him on his mission. He stood a minute or two, waiting.</p>",
  "page-69": "<p> He heard hurried footsteps beyond the door, both halves of it were opened rapidly; all was silent and then from the study the sound was heard of other steps, firm and resolute&mdash;they were those of Napoleon. He had just finished dressing for his ride, and wore a blue uniform, opening in front over a white waistcoat so long that it covered his rotund stomach, white leather breeches tightly fitting the fat thighs of his short legs, and Hessian boots. His short hair had evidently just been brushed, but one lock hung down in the middle of his broad forehead. His plump white neck stood out sharply above the black collar of his uniform, and he smelled of Eau de Cologne. His full face, rather young-looking, with its prominent chin, wore a gracious and majestic expression of imperial welcome.</p>",
  "page-70": "<p>He entered briskly, with a jerk at every step and his head slightly thrown back. His whole short corpulent figure with broad thick shoulders, and chest and stomach involuntarily protruding, had that imposing and stately appearance one sees in men of forty who live in comfort. It was evident, too, that he was in the best of spirits that day.</p><p>He nodded in answer to Balashëv&rsquo;s low and respectful bow, and coming up to him at once began speaking like a man who values every moment of his time and does not condescend to prepare what he has to say but is sure he will always say the right thing and say it well.</p>",
  "page-71": "<p>&ldquo;Good day, General!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have received the letter you brought from the Emperor Alexander and am very glad to see you.&rdquo; He glanced with his large eyes into Balashëv&rsquo;s face and immediately looked past him.</p><p>It was plain that Balashëv&rsquo;s personality did not interest him at all. Evidently only what took place within his own mind interested him. Nothing outside himself had any significance for him, because everything in the world, it seemed to him, depended entirely on his will.</p><p>&ldquo;I do not, and did not, desire war,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;but it has been forced on me. Even now&rdquo; (he emphasized the word) &ldquo;I am ready to receive any explanations you can give me.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-72": "<p>And he began clearly and concisely to explain his reasons for dissatisfaction with the Russian government. Judging by the calmly moderate and amicable tone in which the French Emperor spoke, Balashëv was firmly persuaded that he wished for peace and intended to enter into negotiations.</p><p>When Napoleon, having finished speaking, looked inquiringly at the Russian envoy, Balashëv began a speech he had prepared long before: &ldquo;Sire! The Emperor, my master...&rdquo; but the sight of the Emperor&rsquo;s eyes bent on him confused him. &ldquo;You are flurried&mdash;compose yourself!&rdquo; Napoleon seemed to say, as with a scarcely perceptible smile he looked at Balashëv&rsquo;s uniform and sword.</p>",
  "page-73": "<p>Balashëv recovered himself and began to speak. He said that the Emperor Alexander did not consider Kurákin&rsquo;s demand for his passports a sufficient cause for war; that Kurákin had acted on his own initiative and without his sovereign&rsquo;s assent, that the Emperor Alexander did not desire war, and had no relations with England.</p><p>&ldquo;Not yet!&rdquo; interposed Napoleon, and, as if fearing to give vent to his feelings, he frowned and nodded slightly as a sign that Balashëv might proceed.</p><p>After saying all he had been instructed to say, Balashëv added that the Emperor Alexander wished for peace, but would not enter into negotiations except on condition that... Here Balashëv hesitated: he remembered the words the Emperor Alexander had not written in his letter, but had specially inserted in the rescript to Saltykóv and had told Balashëv to repeat to Napoleon.</p>",
  "page-74": "<p> Balashëv remembered these words, &ldquo;So long as a single armed foe remains on Russian soil,&rdquo; but some complex feeling restrained him. He could not utter them, though he wished to do so. He grew confused and said: &ldquo;On condition that the French army retires beyond the Niemen.&rdquo;</p><p>Napoleon noticed Balashëv&rsquo;s embarrassment when uttering these last words; his face twitched and the calf of his left leg began to quiver rhythmically. Without moving from where he stood he began speaking in a louder tone and more hurriedly than before. During the speech that followed, Balashëv, who more than once lowered his eyes, involuntarily noticed the quivering of Napoleon&rsquo;s left leg which increased the more Napoleon raised his voice.</p>",
  "page-75": "<p>&ldquo;I desire peace, no less than the Emperor Alexander,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;Have I not for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it? I have waited eighteen months for explanations. But in order to begin negotiations, what is demanded of me?&rdquo; he said, frowning and making an energetic gesture of inquiry with his small white plump hand.</p><p>&ldquo;The withdrawal of your army beyond the Niemen, sire,&rdquo; replied Balashëv.</p><p>&ldquo;The Niemen?&rdquo; repeated Napoleon. &ldquo;So now you want me to retire beyond the Niemen&mdash;only the Niemen?&rdquo; repeated Napoleon, looking straight at Balashëv.</p><p>The latter bowed his head respectfully.</p>",
  "page-76": "<p>Instead of the demand of four months earlier to withdraw from Pomerania, only a withdrawal beyond the Niemen was now demanded. Napoleon turned quickly and began to pace the room.</p><p>&ldquo;You say the demand now is that I am to withdraw beyond the Niemen before commencing negotiations, but in just the same way two months ago the demand was that I should withdraw beyond the Vistula and the Oder, and yet you are willing to negotiate.&rdquo;</p><p>He went in silence from one corner of the room to the other and again stopped in front of Balashëv. Balashëv noticed that his left leg was quivering faster than before and his face seemed petrified in its stern expression. This quivering of his left leg was a thing Napoleon was conscious of. &ldquo;The vibration of my left calf is a great sign with me,&rdquo; he remarked at a later date.</p>",
  "page-77": "<p>&ldquo;Such demands as to retreat beyond the Vistula and Oder may be made to a Prince of Baden, but not to me!&rdquo; Napoleon almost screamed, quite to his own surprise. &ldquo;If you gave me Petersburg and Moscow I could not accept such conditions. You say I have begun this war! But who first joined his army? The Emperor Alexander, not I! And you offer me negotiations when I have expended millions, when you are in alliance with England, and when your position is a bad one. You offer me negotiations! But what is the aim of your alliance with England? What has she given you?&rdquo; he continued hurriedly, evidently no longer trying to show the advantages of peace and discuss its possibility, but only to prove his own rectitude and power and Alexander&rsquo;s errors and duplicity.</p>",
  "page-78": "<p>The commencement of his speech had obviously been made with the intention of demonstrating the advantages of his position and showing that he was nevertheless willing to negotiate. But he had begun talking, and the more he talked the less could he control his words.</p><p>The whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to exalt himself and insult Alexander&mdash;just what he had least desired at the commencement of the interview.</p><p>&ldquo;I hear you have made peace with Turkey?&rdquo;</p><p>Balashëv bowed his head affirmatively.</p><p>&ldquo;Peace has been concluded...&rdquo; he began.</p><p>But Napoleon did not let him speak. He evidently wanted to do all the talking himself, and continued to talk with the sort of eloquence and unrestrained irritability to which spoiled people are so prone.</p>",
  "page-79": "<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know you have made peace with the Turks without obtaining Moldavia and Wallachia; I would have given your sovereign those provinces as I gave him Finland. Yes,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I promised and would have given the Emperor Alexander Moldavia and Wallachia, and now he won&rsquo;t have those splendid provinces. Yet he might have united them to his empire and in a single reign would have extended Russia from the Gulf of Bothnia to the mouths of the Danube. Catherine the Great could not have done more,&rdquo; said Napoleon, growing more and more excited as he paced up and down the room, repeating to Balashëv almost the very words he had used to Alexander himself at Tilsit. &ldquo;All that, he would have owed to my friendship. Oh, what a splendid reign!&rdquo; he repeated several times, then paused, drew from his pocket a gold snuffbox, lifted it to his nose, and greedily sniffed at it.</p>",
  "page-80": "<p>&ldquo;What a splendid reign the Emperor Alexander&rsquo;s might have been!&rdquo;</p><p>He looked compassionately at Balashëv, and as soon as the latter tried to make some rejoinder hastily interrupted him.</p><p>&ldquo;What could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained through my friendship?&rdquo; demanded Napoleon, shrugging his shoulders in perplexity. &ldquo;But no, he has preferred to surround himself with my enemies, and with whom? With Steins, Armfeldts, Bennigsens, and Wintzingerodes! Stein, a traitor expelled from his own country; Armfeldt, a rake and an intriguer; Wintzingerode, a fugitive French subject; Bennigsen, rather more of a soldier than the others, but all the same an incompetent who was unable to do anything in 1807 and who should awaken terrible memories in the Emperor Alexander&rsquo;s mind....</p>",
  "page-81": "<p> Granted that were they competent they might be made use of,&rdquo; continued Napoleon&mdash;hardly able to keep pace in words with the rush of thoughts that incessantly sprang up, proving how right and strong he was (in his perception the two were one and the same)&mdash;&ldquo;but they are not even that! They are neither fit for war nor peace! Barclay is said to be the most capable of them all, but I cannot say so, judging by his first movements. And what are they doing, all these courtiers? Pfuel proposes, Armfeldt disputes, Bennigsen considers, and Barclay, called on to act, does not know what to decide on, and time passes bringing no result. Bagratión alone is a military man. He&rsquo;s stupid, but he has experience, a quick eye, and resolution.... And what role is your young monarch playing in that monstrous crowd? They compromise him and throw on him the responsibility for all that happens.</p>",
  "page-82": "<p> A sovereign should not be with the army unless he is a general!&rdquo; said Napoleon, evidently uttering these words as a direct challenge to the Emperor. He knew how Alexander desired to be a military commander.</p><p>&ldquo;The campaign began only a week ago, and you haven&rsquo;t even been able to defend Vílna. You are cut in two and have been driven out of the Polish provinces. Your army is grumbling.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On the contrary, Your Majesty,&rdquo; said Balashëv, hardly able to remember what had been said to him and following these verbal fireworks with difficulty, &ldquo;the troops are burning with eagerness...&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-83": "<p>&ldquo;I know everything!&rdquo; Napoleon interrupted him. &ldquo;I know everything. I know the number of your battalions as exactly as I know my own. You have not two hundred thousand men, and I have three times that number. I give you my word of honor,&rdquo; said Napoleon, forgetting that his word of honor could carry no weight&mdash;&ldquo;I give you my word of honor that I have five hundred and thirty thousand men this side of the Vistula. The Turks will be of no use to you; they are worth nothing and have shown it by making peace with you. As for the Swedes&mdash;it is their fate to be governed by mad kings. Their king was insane and they changed him for another&mdash;Bernadotte, who promptly went mad&mdash;for no Swede would ally himself with Russia unless he were mad.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-84": "<p>Napoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his nose.</p><p>Balashëv knew how to reply to each of Napoleon&rsquo;s remarks, and would have done so; he continually made the gesture of a man wishing to say something, but Napoleon always interrupted him. To the alleged insanity of the Swedes, Balashëv wished to reply that when Russia is on her side Sweden is practically an island: but Napoleon gave an angry exclamation to drown his voice. Napoleon was in that state of irritability in which a man has to talk, talk, and talk, merely to convince himself that he is in the right. Balashëv began to feel uncomfortable: as envoy he feared to demean his dignity and felt the necessity of replying; but, as a man, he shrank before the transport of groundless wrath that had evidently seized Napoleon.</p>",
  "page-85": "<p> He knew that none of the words now uttered by Napoleon had any significance, and that Napoleon himself would be ashamed of them when he came to his senses. Balashëv stood with downcast eyes, looking at the movements of Napoleon&rsquo;s stout legs and trying to avoid meeting his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;But what do I care about your allies?&rdquo; said Napoleon. &ldquo;I have allies&mdash;the Poles. There are eighty thousand of them and they fight like lions. And there will be two hundred thousand of them.&rdquo;</p><p>And probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered this obvious falsehood, and that Balashëv still stood silently before him in the same attitude of submission to fate, Napoleon abruptly turned round, drew close to Balashëv&rsquo;s face, and, gesticulating rapidly and energetically with his white hands, almost shouted:</p>",
  "page-86": "<p>&ldquo;Know that if you stir up Prussia against me, I&rsquo;ll wipe it off the map of Europe!&rdquo; he declared, his face pale and distorted by anger, and he struck one of his small hands energetically with the other. &ldquo;Yes, I will throw you back beyond the Dvína and beyond the Dnieper, and will re-erect against you that barrier which it was criminal and blind of Europe to allow to be destroyed. Yes, that is what will happen to you. That is what you have gained by alienating me!&rdquo; And he walked silently several times up and down the room, his fat shoulders twitching.</p><p>He put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket, took it out again, lifted it several times to his nose, and stopped in front of Balashëv. He paused, looked ironically straight into Balashëv&rsquo;s eyes, and said in a quiet voice:</p>",
  "page-87": "<p>&ldquo;And yet what a splendid reign your master might have had!&rdquo;</p><p>Balashëv, feeling it incumbent on him to reply, said that from the Russian side things did not appear in so gloomy a light. Napoleon was silent, still looking derisively at him and evidently not listening to him. Balashëv said that in Russia the best results were expected from the war. Napoleon nodded condescendingly, as if to say, &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s your duty to say that, but you don&rsquo;t believe it yourself. I have convinced you.&rdquo;</p><p>When Balashëv had ended, Napoleon again took out his snuffbox, sniffed at it, and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal. The door opened, a gentleman-in-waiting, bending respectfully, handed the Emperor his hat and gloves; another brought him a pocket handkerchief. Napoleon, without giving them a glance, turned to Balashëv:</p>",
  "page-88": "<p>&ldquo;Assure the Emperor Alexander from me,&rdquo; said he, taking his hat, &ldquo;that I am as devoted to him as before: I know him thoroughly and very highly esteem his lofty qualities. I will detain you no longer, General; you shall receive my letter to the Emperor.&rdquo;</p><p>And Napoleon went quickly to the door. Everyone in the reception room rushed forward and descended the staircase.</p>",
  "page-89": "<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>",
  "page-90": "<p>After all that Napoleon had said to him&mdash;those bursts of anger and the last dryly spoken words: &ldquo;I will detain you no longer, General; you shall receive my letter,&rdquo; Balashëv felt convinced that Napoleon would not wish to see him, and would even avoid another meeting with him&mdash;an insulted envoy&mdash;especially as he had witnessed his unseemly anger. But, to his surprise, Balashëv received, through Duroc, an invitation to dine with the Emperor that day.</p><p>Bessières, Caulaincourt, and Berthier were present at that dinner.</p><p>Napoleon met Balashëv cheerfully and amiably. He not only showed no sign of constraint or self-reproach on account of his outburst that morning, but, on the contrary, tried to reassure Balashëv. It was evident that he had long been convinced that it was impossible for him to make a mistake, and that in his perception whatever he did was right, not because it harmonized with any idea of right and wrong, but because he did it.</p>",
  "page-91": "<p>The Emperor was in very good spirits after his ride through Vílna, where crowds of people had rapturously greeted and followed him. From all the windows of the streets through which he rode, rugs, flags, and his monogram were displayed, and the Polish ladies, welcoming him, waved their handkerchiefs to him.</p><p>At dinner, having placed Balashëv beside him, Napoleon not only treated him amiably but behaved as if Balashëv were one of his own courtiers, one of those who sympathized with his plans and ought to rejoice at his success. In the course of conversation he mentioned Moscow and questioned Balashëv about the Russian capital, not merely as an interested traveler asks about a new city he intends to visit, but as if convinced that Balashëv, as a Russian, must be flattered by his curiosity.</p>",
  "page-92": "<p>&ldquo;How many inhabitants are there in Moscow? How many houses? Is it true that Moscow is called &lsquo;Holy Moscow&rsquo;? How many churches are there in Moscow?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>And receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred churches, he remarked:</p><p>&ldquo;Why such a quantity of churches?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Russians are very devout,&rdquo; replied Balashëv.</p><p>&ldquo;But a large number of monasteries and churches is always a sign of the backwardness of a people,&rdquo; said Napoleon, turning to Caulaincourt for appreciation of this remark.</p><p>Balashëv respectfully ventured to disagree with the French Emperor.</p>",
  "page-93": "<p>&ldquo;Every country has its own character,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>&ldquo;But nowhere in Europe is there anything like that,&rdquo; said Napoleon.</p><p>&ldquo;I beg your Majesty&rsquo;s pardon,&rdquo; returned Balashëv, &ldquo;besides Russia there is Spain, where there are also many churches and monasteries.&rdquo;</p><p>This reply of Balashëv&rsquo;s, which hinted at the recent defeats of the French in Spain, was much appreciated when he related it at Alexander&rsquo;s court, but it was not much appreciated at Napoleon&rsquo;s dinner, where it passed unnoticed.</p><p>The uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that they were puzzled as to what Balashëv&rsquo;s tone suggested. &ldquo;If there is a point we don&rsquo;t see it, or it is not at all witty,&rdquo; their expressions seemed to say.</p>",
  "page-94": "<p> So little was his rejoinder appreciated that Napoleon did not notice it at all and naïvely asked Balashëv through what towns the direct road from there to Moscow passed. Balashëv, who was on the alert all through the dinner, replied that just as &ldquo;all roads lead to Rome,&rdquo; so all roads lead to Moscow: there were many roads, and &ldquo;among them the road through Poltáva, which Charles XII chose.&rdquo; Balashëv involuntarily flushed with pleasure at the aptitude of this reply, but hardly had he uttered the word Poltáva before Caulaincourt began speaking of the badness of the road from Petersburg to Moscow and of his Petersburg reminiscences.</p><p>After dinner they went to drink coffee in Napoleon&rsquo;s study, which four days previously had been that of the Emperor Alexander. Napoleon sat down, toying with his Sèvres coffee cup, and motioned Balashëv to a chair beside him.</p>",
  "page-95": "<p>Napoleon was in that well-known after-dinner mood which, more than any reasoned cause, makes a man contented with himself and disposed to consider everyone his friend. It seemed to him that he was surrounded by men who adored him: and he felt convinced that, after his dinner, Balashëv too was his friend and worshiper. Napoleon turned to him with a pleasant, though slightly ironic, smile.</p><p>&ldquo;They tell me this is the room the Emperor Alexander occupied? Strange, isn&rsquo;t it, General?&rdquo; he said, evidently not doubting that this remark would be agreeable to his hearer since it went to prove his, Napoleon&rsquo;s, superiority to Alexander.</p><p>Balashëv made no reply and bowed his head in silence.</p>",
  "page-96": "<p>&ldquo;Yes. Four days ago in this room, Wintzingerode and Stein were deliberating,&rdquo; continued Napoleon with the same derisive and self-confident smile. &ldquo;What I can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;is that the Emperor Alexander has surrounded himself with my personal enemies. That I do not... understand. Has he not thought that I may do the same?&rdquo; and he turned inquiringly to Balashëv, and evidently this thought turned him back on to the track of his morning&rsquo;s anger, which was still fresh in him.</p><p>&ldquo;And let him know that I will do so!&rdquo; said Napoleon, rising and pushing his cup away with his hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive all his Württemberg, Baden, and Weimar relations out of Germany.... Yes. I&rsquo;ll drive them out. Let him prepare an asylum for them in Russia!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-97": "<p>Balashëv bowed his head with an air indicating that he would like to make his bow and leave, and only listened because he could not help hearing what was said to him. Napoleon did not notice this expression; he treated Balashëv not as an envoy from his enemy, but as a man now fully devoted to him and who must rejoice at his former master&rsquo;s humiliation.</p><p>&ldquo;And why has the Emperor Alexander taken command of the armies?

  "page-101": "<p>After his interview with Pierre in Moscow, Prince Andrew went to Petersburg, on business as he told his family, but really to meet Anatole Kurágin whom he felt it necessary to encounter. On reaching Petersburg he inquired for Kurágin but the latter had already left the city. Pierre had warned his brother-in-law that Prince Andrew was on his track. Anatole Kurágin promptly obtained an appointment from the Minister of War and went to join the army in Moldavia. While in Petersburg Prince Andrew met Kutúzov, his former commander who was always well disposed toward him, and Kutúzov suggested that he should accompany him to the army in Moldavia, to which the old general had been appointed commander in chief. So Prince Andrew, having received an appointment on the headquarters staff, left for Turkey.</p>",
  "page-102": "<p>Prince Andrew did not think it proper to write and challenge Kurágin. He thought that if he challenged him without some fresh cause it might compromise the young Countess Rostóva and so he wanted to meet Kurágin personally in order to find a fresh pretext for a duel. But he again failed to meet Kurágin in Turkey, for soon after Prince Andrew arrived, the latter returned to Russia. In a new country, amid new conditions, Prince Andrew found life easier to bear. After his betrothed had broken faith with him&mdash;which he felt the more acutely the more he tried to conceal its effects&mdash;the surroundings in which he had been happy became trying to him, and the freedom and independence he had once prized so highly were still more so.</p>",
  "page-103": "<p> Not only could he no longer think the thoughts that had first come to him as he lay gazing at the sky on the field of Austerlitz and had later enlarged upon with Pierre, and which had filled his solitude at Boguchárovo and then in Switzerland and Rome, but he even dreaded to recall them and the bright and boundless horizons they had revealed. He was now concerned only with the nearest practical matters unrelated to his past interests, and he seized on these the more eagerly the more those past interests were closed to him. It was as if that lofty, infinite canopy of heaven that had once towered above him had suddenly turned into a low, solid vault that weighed him down, in which all was clear, but nothing eternal or mysterious.</p>",
  "page-104": "<p>Of the activities that presented themselves to him, army service was the simplest and most familiar. As a general on duty on Kutúzov&rsquo;s staff, he applied himself to business with zeal and perseverance and surprised Kutúzov by his willingness and accuracy in work. Not having found Kurágin in Turkey, Prince Andrew did not think it necessary to rush back to Russia after him, but all the same he knew that however long it might be before he met Kurágin, despite his contempt for him and despite all the proofs he deduced to convince himself that it was not worth stooping to a conflict with him&mdash;he knew that when he did meet him he would not be able to resist calling him out, any more than a ravenous man can help snatching at food.</p>",
  "page-105": "<p> And the consciousness that the insult was not yet avenged, that his rancor was still unspent, weighed on his heart and poisoned the artificial tranquillity which he managed to obtain in Turkey by means of restless, plodding, and rather vainglorious and ambitious activity.</p><p>In the year 1812, when news of the war with Napoleon reached Bucharest&mdash;where Kutúzov had been living for two months, passing his days and nights with a Wallachian woman&mdash;Prince Andrew asked Kutúzov to transfer him to the Western Army. Kutúzov, who was already weary of Bolkónski&rsquo;s activity which seemed to reproach his own idleness, very readily let him go and gave him a mission to Barclay de Tolly.</p>",
  "page-106": "<p>Before joining the Western Army which was then, in May, encamped at Drissa, Prince Andrew visited Bald Hills which was directly on his way, being only two miles off the Smolénsk highroad. During the last three years there had been so many changes in his life, he had thought, felt, and seen so much (having traveled both in the east and the west), that on reaching Bald Hills it struck him as strange and unexpected to find the way of life there unchanged and still the same in every detail. He entered through the gates with their stone pillars and drove up the avenue leading to the house as if he were entering an enchanted, sleeping castle. The same old stateliness, the same cleanliness, the same stillness reigned there, and inside there was the same furniture, the same walls, sounds, and smell, and the same timid faces, only somewhat older.</p>",
  "page-107": "<p> Princess Mary was still the same timid, plain maiden getting on in years, uselessly and joylessly passing the best years of her life in fear and constant suffering. Mademoiselle Bourienne was the same coquettish, self-satisfied girl, enjoying every moment of her existence and full of joyous hopes for the future. She had merely become more self-confident, Prince Andrew thought. Dessalles, the tutor he had brought from Switzerland, was wearing a coat of Russian cut and talking broken Russian to the servants, but was still the same narrowly intelligent, conscientious, and pedantic preceptor. The old prince had changed in appearance only by the loss of a tooth, which left a noticeable gap on one side of his mouth; in character he was the same as ever, only showing still more irritability and skepticism as to what was happening in the world. Little Nicholas alone had changed.</p>",
  "page-108": "<p> He had grown, become rosier, had curly dark hair, and, when merry and laughing, quite unconsciously lifted the upper lip of his pretty little mouth just as the little princess used to do. He alone did not obey the law of immutability in the enchanted, sleeping castle. But though externally all remained as of old, the inner relations of all these people had changed since Prince Andrew had seen them last. The household was divided into two alien and hostile camps, who changed their habits for his sake and only met because he was there. To the one camp belonged the old prince, Mademoiselle Bourienne, and the architect; to the other Princess Mary, Dessalles, little Nicholas, and all the old nurses and maids.</p><p>During his stay at Bald Hills all the family dined together, but they were ill at ease and Prince Andrew felt that he was a visitor for whose sake an exception was being made and that his presence made them all feel awkward.</p>",
  "page-109": "<p> Involuntarily feeling this at dinner on the first day, he was taciturn, and the old prince noticing this also became morosely dumb and retired to his apartments directly after dinner. In the evening, when Prince Andrew went to him and, trying to rouse him, began to tell him of the young Count Kámensky&rsquo;s campaign, the old prince began unexpectedly to talk about Princess Mary, blaming her for her superstitions and her dislike of Mademoiselle Bourienne, who, he said, was the only person really attached to him.</p><p>The old prince said that if he was ill it was only because of Princess Mary: that she purposely worried and irritated him, and that by indulgence and silly talk she was spoiling little Prince Nicholas. The old prince knew very well that he tormented his daughter and that her life was very hard, but he also knew that he could not help tormenting her and that she deserved it.</p>",
  "page-110": "<p> &ldquo;Why does Prince Andrew, who sees this, say nothing to me about his sister? Does he think me a scoundrel, or an old fool who, without any reason, keeps his own daughter at a distance and attaches this Frenchwoman to himself? He doesn&rsquo;t understand, so I must explain it, and he must hear me out,&rdquo; thought the old prince. And he began explaining why he could not put up with his daughter&rsquo;s unreasonable character.</p><p>&ldquo;If you ask me,&rdquo; said Prince Andrew, without looking up (he was censuring his father for the first time in his life), &ldquo;I did not wish to speak about it, but as you ask me I will give you my frank opinion. If there is any misunderstanding and discord between you and Mary, I can&rsquo;t blame her for it at all. I know how she loves and respects you.</p>",
  "page-111": "<p> Since you ask me,&rdquo; continued Prince Andrew, becoming irritable&mdash;as he was always liable to do of late&mdash;&ldquo;I can only say that if there are any misunderstandings they are caused by that worthless woman, who is not fit to be my sister&rsquo;s companion.&rdquo;</p><p>The old man at first stared fixedly at his son, and an unnatural smile disclosed the fresh gap between his teeth to which Prince Andrew could not get accustomed.</p><p>&ldquo;What companion, my dear boy? Eh? You&rsquo;ve already been talking it over! Eh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Father, I did not want to judge,&rdquo; said Prince Andrew, in a hard and bitter tone, &ldquo;but you challenged me, and I have said, and always shall say, that Mary is not to blame, but those to blame&mdash;the one to blame&mdash;is that Frenchwoman.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-112": "<p>&ldquo;Ah, he has passed judgment... passed judgement!&rdquo; said the old man in a low voice and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, with some embarrassment, but then he suddenly jumped up and cried: &ldquo;Be off, be off! Let not a trace of you remain here!...&rdquo;</p><p>Prince Andrew wished to leave at once, but Princess Mary persuaded him to stay another day. That day he did not see his father, who did not leave his room and admitted no one but Mademoiselle Bourienne and Tíkhon, but asked several times whether his son had gone. Next day, before leaving, Prince Andrew went to his son&rsquo;s rooms. The boy, curly-headed like his mother and glowing with health, sat on his knee, and Prince Andrew began telling him the story of Bluebeard, but fell into a reverie without finishing the story. He thought not of this pretty child, his son whom he held on his knee, but of himself.</p>",
  "page-113": "<p> He sought in himself either remorse for having angered his father or regret at leaving home for the first time in his life on bad terms with him, and was horrified to find neither. What meant still more to him was that he sought and did not find in himself the former tenderness for his son which he had hoped to reawaken by caressing the boy and taking him on his knee.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, go on!&rdquo; said his son.</p><p>Prince Andrew, without replying, put him down from his knee and went out of the room.</p><p>As soon as Prince Andrew had given up his daily occupations, and especially on returning to the old conditions of life amid which he had been happy, weariness of life overcame him with its former intensity, and he hastened to escape from these memories and to find some work as soon as possible.</p>",
  "page-114": "<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve decided to go, Andrew?&rdquo; asked his sister.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank God that I can,&rdquo; replied Prince Andrew. &ldquo;I am very sorry you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo; replied Princess Mary. &ldquo;Why do you say that, when you are going to this terrible war, and he is so old? Mademoiselle Bourienne says he has been asking about you....&rdquo;</p><p>As soon as she began to speak of that, her lips trembled and her tears began to fall. Prince Andrew turned away and began pacing the room.</p>",
  "page-115": "<p>&ldquo;Ah, my God! my God! When one thinks who and what&mdash;what trash&mdash;can cause people misery!&rdquo; he said with a malignity that alarmed Princess Mary.</p><p>She understood that when speaking of &ldquo;trash&rdquo; he referred not only to Mademoiselle Bourienne, the cause of her misery, but also to the man who had ruined his own happiness.</p><p>&ldquo;Andrew! One thing I beg, I entreat of you!&rdquo; she said, touching his elbow and looking at him with eyes that shone through her tears. &ldquo;I understand you&rdquo; (she looked down). &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t imagine that sorrow is the work of men. Men are His tools.&rdquo; She looked a little above Prince Andrew&rsquo;s head with the confident, accustomed look with which one looks at the place where a familiar portrait hangs. &ldquo;Sorrow is sent by Him, not by men. Men are His instruments, they are not to blame.</p>",
  "page-116": "<p> If you think someone has wronged you, forget it and forgive! We have no right to punish. And then you will know the happiness of forgiving.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If I were a woman I would do so, Mary. That is a woman&rsquo;s virtue. But a man should not and cannot forgive and forget,&rdquo; he replied, and though till that moment he had not been thinking of Kurágin, all his unexpended anger suddenly swelled up in his heart.</p><p>&ldquo;If Mary is already persuading me to forgive, it means that I ought long ago to have punished him,&rdquo; he thought. And giving her no further reply, he began thinking of the glad vindictive moment when he would meet Kurágin who he knew was now in the army.</p>",
  "page-117": "<p>Princess Mary begged him to stay one day more, saying that she knew how unhappy her father would be if Andrew left without being reconciled to him, but Prince Andrew replied that he would probably soon be back again from the army and would certainly write to his father, but that the longer he stayed now the more embittered their differences would become.</p><p>&ldquo;Good-by, Andrew! Remember that misfortunes come from God, and men are never to blame,&rdquo; were the last words he heard from his sister when he took leave of her.</p><p>&ldquo;Then it must be so!&rdquo; thought Prince Andrew as he drove out of the avenue from the house at Bald Hills. &ldquo;She, poor innocent creature, is left to be victimized by an old man who has outlived his wits. The old man feels he is guilty, but cannot change himself.</p>",
  "page-118": "<p> My boy is growing up and rejoices in life, in which like everybody else he will deceive or be deceived. And I am off to the army. Why? I myself don&rsquo;t know. I want to meet that man whom I despise, so as to give him a chance to kill and laugh at me!&rdquo;</p><p>These conditions of life had been the same before, but then they were all connected, while now they had all tumbled to pieces. Only senseless things, lacking coherence, presented themselves one after another to Prince Andrew&rsquo;s mind.</p>",
  "page-119": "<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>",
  "page-120": "<p>Prince Andrew reached the general headquarters of the army at the end of June. The first army, with which was the Emperor, occupied the fortified camp at Drissa; the second army was retreating, trying to effect a junction with the first one from which it was said to be cut off by large French forces. Everyone was dissatisfied with the general course of affairs in the Russian army, but no one anticipated any danger of invasion of the Russian provinces, and no one thought the war would extend farther than the western, the Polish, provinces.</p><p>Prince Andrew found Barclay de Tolly, to whom he had been assigned, on the bank of the Drissa. As there was not a single town or large village in the vicinity of the camp, the immense number of generals and courtiers accompanying the army were living in the best houses of the villages on both sides of the river, over a radius of six miles.</p>",
  "page-121": "<p> Barclay de Tolly was quartered nearly three miles from the Emperor. He received Bolkónski stiffly and coldly and told him in his foreign accent that he would mention him to the Emperor for a decision as to his employment, but asked him meanwhile to remain on his staff. Anatole Kurágin, whom Prince Andrew had hoped to find with the army, was not there. He had gone to Petersburg, but Prince Andrew was glad to hear this. His mind was occupied by the interests of the center that was conducting a gigantic war, and he was glad to be free for a while from the distraction caused by the thought of Kurágin. During the first four days, while no duties were required of him, Prince Andrew rode round the whole fortified camp and, by the aid of his own knowledge and by talks with experts, tried to form a definite opinion about it.</p>",
  "page-122": "<p> But the question whether the camp was advantageous or disadvantageous remained for him undecided. Already from his military experience and what he had seen in the Austrian campaign, he had come to the conclusion that in war the most deeply considered plans have no significance and that all depends on the way unexpected movements of the enemy&mdash;that cannot be foreseen&mdash;are met, and on how and by whom the whole matter is handled. To clear up this last point for himself, Prince Andrew, utilizing his position and acquaintances, tried to fathom the character of the control of the army and of the men and parties engaged in it, and he deduced for himself the following of the state of affairs.</p><p>While the Emperor had still been at Vílna, the forces had been divided into three armies.</p>",
  "page-123": "<p> First, the army under Barclay de Tolly, secondly, the army under Bagratión, and thirdly, the one commanded by Tormásov. The Emperor was with the first army, but not as commander in chief. In the orders issued it was stated, not that the Emperor would take command, but only that he would be with the army. The Emperor, moreover, had with him not a commander in chief&rsquo;s staff but the imperial headquarters staff. In attendance on him was the head of the imperial staff, Quartermaster General Prince Volkónski, as well as generals, imperial aides-de-camp, diplomatic officials, and a large number of foreigners, but not the army staff. Besides these, there were in attendance on the Emperor without any definite appointments: Arakchéev, the ex-Minister of War; Count Bennigsen, the senior general in rank; the Grand Duke Tsarévich Constantine Pávlovich; Count Rumyántsev, the Chancellor;</p>",
  "page-124": "<p> Stein, a former Prussian minister; Armfeldt, a Swedish general; Pfuel, the chief author of the plan of campaign; Paulucci, an adjutant general and Sardinian émigré; Wolzogen&mdash;and many others. Though these men had no military appointment in the army, their position gave them influence, and often a corps commander, or even the commander in chief, did not know in what capacity he was questioned by Bennigsen, the Grand Duke, Arakchéev, or Prince Volkónski, or was given this or that advice and did not know whether a certain order received in the form of advice emanated from the man who gave it or from the Emperor and whether it had to be executed or not. But this was only the external condition; the essential significance of the presence of the Emperor and of all these people, from a courtier&rsquo;s point of view (and in an Emperor&rsquo;s vicinity all became courtiers), was clear to everyone.</p>",
  "page-125": "<p> It was this: the Emperor did not assume the title of commander in chief, but disposed of all the armies; the men around him were his assistants. Arakchéev was a faithful custodian to enforce order and acted as the sovereign&rsquo;s bodyguard. Bennigsen was a landlord in the Vílna province who appeared to be doing the honors of the district, but was in reality a good general, useful as an adviser and ready at hand to replace Barclay. The Grand Duke was there because it suited him to be. The ex-Minister Stein was there because his advice was useful and the Emperor Alexander held him in high esteem personally. Armfeldt virulently hated Napoleon and was a general full of self-confidence, a quality that always influenced Alexander. Paulucci was there because he was bold and decided in speech.</p>",
  "page-126": "<p> The adjutants general were there because they always accompanied the Emperor, and lastly and chiefly Pfuel was there because he had drawn up the plan of campaign against Napoleon and, having induced Alexander to believe in the efficacy of that plan, was directing the whole business of the war. With Pfuel was Wolzogen, who expressed Pfuel&rsquo;s thoughts in a more comprehensible way than Pfuel himself (who was a harsh, bookish theorist, self-confident to the point of despising everyone else) was able to do.</p><p>Besides these Russians and foreigners who propounded new and unexpected ideas every day&mdash;especially the foreigners, who did so with a boldness characteristic of people employed in a country not their own&mdash;there were many secondary personages accompanying the army because their principals were there.</p>",
  "page-127": "<p>Among the opinions and voices in this immense, restless, brilliant, and proud sphere, Prince Andrew noticed the following sharply defined subdivisions of tendencies and parties:</p><p>The first party consisted of Pfuel and his adherents&mdash;military theorists who believed in a science of war with immutable laws&mdash;laws of oblique movements, outflankings, and so forth. Pfuel and his adherents demanded a retirement into the depths of the country in accordance with precise laws defined by a pseudo-theory of war, and they saw only barbarism, ignorance, or evil intention in every deviation from that theory. To this party belonged the foreign nobles, Wolzogen, Wintzingerode, and others, chiefly Germans.</p><p>The second party was directly opposed to the first; one extreme, as always happens, was met by representatives of the other. The members of this party were those who had demanded an advance from Vílna into Poland and freedom from all prearranged plans.</p>",
  "page-128": "<p> Besides being advocates of bold action, this section also represented nationalism, which made them still more one-sided in the dispute. They were Russians: Bagratión, Ermólov (who was beginning to come to the front), and others. At that time a famous joke of Ermólov&rsquo;s was being circulated, that as a great favor he had petitioned the Emperor to make him a German. The men of that party, remembering Suvórov, said that what one had to do was not to reason, or stick pins into maps, but to fight, beat the enemy, keep him out of Russia, and not let the army get discouraged.</p><p>To the third party&mdash;in which the Emperor had most confidence&mdash;belonged the courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the other two.</p>",
  "page-129": "<p> The members of this party, chiefly civilians and to whom Arakchéev belonged, thought and said what men who have no convictions but wish to seem to have some generally say. They said that undoubtedly war, particularly against such a genius as Bonaparte (they called him Bonaparte now), needs most deeply devised plans and profound scientific knowledge and in that respect Pfuel was a genius, but at the same time it had to be acknowledged that the theorists are often one-sided, and therefore one should not trust them absolutely, but should also listen to what Pfuel&rsquo;s opponents and practical men of experience in warfare had to say, and then choose a middle course. They insisted on the retention of the camp at Drissa, according to Pfuel&rsquo;s plan, but on changing the movements of the other armies.</p>",
  "page-130": "<p> Though, by this course, neither one aim nor the other could be attained, yet it seemed best to the adherents of this third party.</p><p>Of a fourth opinion the most conspicuous representative was the Tsarévich, who could not forget his disillusionment at Austerlitz, where he had ridden out at the head of the Guards, in his casque and cavalry uniform as to a review, expecting to crush the French gallantly; but unexpectedly finding himself in the front line had narrowly escaped amid the general confusion. The men of this party had both the quality and the defect of frankness in their opinions. They feared Napoleon, recognized his strength and their own weakness, and frankly said so. They said: &ldquo;Nothing but sorrow, shame, and ruin will come of all this! We have abandoned Vílna and Vítebsk and shall abandon Drissa.</p>",
  "page-131": "<p> The only reasonable thing left to do is to conclude peace as soon as possible, before we are turned out of Petersburg.&rdquo;</p><p>This view was very general in the upper army circles and found support also in Petersburg and from the chancellor, Rumyántsev, who, for other reasons of state, was in favor of peace.</p><p>The fifth party consisted of those who were adherents of Barclay de Tolly, not so much as a man but as minister of war and commander in chief. &ldquo;Be he what he may&rdquo; (they always began like that), &ldquo;he is an honest, practical man and we have nobody better. Give him real power, for war cannot be conducted successfully without unity of command, and he will show what he can do, as he did in Finland. If our army is well organized and strong and has withdrawn to Drissa without suffering any defeats, we owe this entirely to Barclay.</p>",
  "page-132": "<p> If Barclay is now to be superseded by Bennigsen all will be lost, for Bennigsen showed his incapacity already in 1807.&rdquo;</p><p>The sixth party, the Bennigsenites, said, on the contrary, that at any rate there was no one more active and experienced than Bennigsen: &ldquo;and twist about as you may, you will have to come to Bennigsen eventually. Let the others make mistakes now!&rdquo; said they, arguing that our retirement to Drissa was a most shameful reverse and an unbroken series of blunders. &ldquo;The more mistakes that are made the better. It will at any rate be understood all the sooner that things cannot go on like this. What is wanted is not some Barclay or other, but a man like Bennigsen, who made his mark in 1807, and to whom Napoleon himself did justice&mdash;a man whose authority would be willingly recognized, and Bennigsen is the only such man.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-133": "<p>The seventh party consisted of the sort of people who are always to be found, especially around young sovereigns, and of whom there were particularly many round Alexander&mdash;generals and imperial aides-de-camp passionately devoted to the Emperor, not merely as a monarch but as a man, adoring him sincerely and disinterestedly, as Rostóv had done in 1805, and who saw in him not only all the virtues but all human capabilities as well. These men, though enchanted with the sovereign for refusing the command of the army, yet blamed him for such excessive modesty, and only desired and insisted that their adored sovereign should abandon his diffidence and openly announce that he would place himself at the head of the army, gather round him a commander in chief&rsquo;s staff, and, consulting experienced theoreticians and practical men where necessary, would himself lead the troops, whose spirits would thereby be raised to the highest pitch.</p>",
  "page-134": "<p>The eighth and largest group, which in its enormous numbers was to the others as ninety-nine to one, consisted of men who desired neither peace nor war, neither an advance nor a defensive camp at the Drissa or anywhere else, neither Barclay nor the Emperor, neither Pfuel nor Bennigsen, but only the one most essential thing&mdash;as much advantage and pleasure for themselves as possible. In the troubled waters of conflicting and intersecting intrigues that eddied about the Emperor&rsquo;s headquarters, it was possible to succeed in many ways unthinkable at other times. A man who simply wished to retain his lucrative post would today agree with Pfuel, tomorrow with his opponent, and the day after, merely to avoid responsibility or to please the Emperor, would declare that he had no opinion at all on the matter.</p>",
  "page-135": "<p> Another who wished to gain some advantage would attract the Emperor&rsquo;s attention by loudly advocating the very thing the Emperor had hinted at the day before, and would dispute and shout at the council, beating his breast and challenging those who did not agree with him to duels, thereby proving that he was prepared to sacrifice himself for the common good. A third, in the absence of opponents, between two councils would simply solicit a special gratuity for his faithful services, well knowing that at that moment people would be too busy to refuse him. A fourth while seemingly overwhelmed with work would often come accidentally under the Emperor&rsquo;s eye. A fifth, to achieve his long-cherished aim of dining with the Emperor, would stubbornly insist on the correctness or falsity of some newly emerging opinion and for this object would produce arguments more or less forcible and correct.</p>",
  "page-136": "<p>All the men of this party were fishing for rubles, decorations, and promotions, and in this pursuit watched only the weathercock of imperial favor, and directly they noticed it turning in any direction, this whole drone population of the army began blowing hard that way, so that it was all the harder for the Emperor to turn it elsewhere. Amid the uncertainties of the position, with the menace of serious danger giving a peculiarly threatening character to everything, amid this vortex of intrigue, egotism, conflict of views and feelings, and the diversity of race among these people&mdash;this eighth and largest party of those preoccupied with personal interests imparted great confusion and obscurity to the common task. Whatever question arose, a swarm of these drones, without having finished their buzzing on a previous theme, flew over to the new one and by their hum drowned and obscured the voices of those who were disputing honestly.</p>",
  "page-137": "<p>From among all these parties, just at the time Prince Andrew reached the army, another, a ninth party, was being formed and was beginning to raise its voice. This was the party of the elders, reasonable men experienced and capable in state affairs, who, without sharing any of those conflicting opinions, were able to take a detached view of what was going on at the staff at headquarters and to consider means of escape from this muddle, indecision, intricacy, and weakness.</p><p>The men of this party said and thought that what was wrong resulted chiefly from the Emperor&rsquo;s presence in the army with his military court and from the consequent presence there of an indefinite, conditional, and unsteady fluctuation of relations, which is in place at court but harmful in an army;</p>",
  "page-138": "<p> that a sovereign should reign but not command the army, and that the only way out of the position would be for the Emperor and his court to leave the army; that the mere presence of the Emperor paralyzed the action of fifty thousand men required to secure his personal safety, and that the worst commander in chief, if independent, would be better than the very best one trammeled by the presence and authority of the monarch.</p><p>Just at the time Prince Andrew was living unoccupied at Drissa, Shishkóv, the Secretary of State and one of the chief representatives of this party, wrote a letter to the Emperor which Arakchéev and Balashëv agreed to sign. In this letter, availing himself of permission given him by the Emperor to discuss the general course of affairs, he respectfully suggested&mdash;</p>",
  "page-139": "<p>on the plea that it was necessary for the sovereign to arouse a warlike spirit in the people of the capital&mdash;that the Emperor should leave the army.</p><p>That arousing of the people by their sovereign and his call to them to defend their country&mdash;the very incitement which was the chief cause of Russia&rsquo;s triumph in so far as it was produced by the Tsar&rsquo;s personal presence in Moscow&mdash;was suggested to the Emperor, and accepted by him, as a pretext for quitting the army.</p>",
  "page-140": "<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>",
  "page-141": "<p>This letter had not yet been presented to the Emperor when Barclay, one day at dinner, informed Bolkónski that the sovereign wished to see him personally, to question him about Turkey, and that Prince Andrew was to present himself at Bennigsen&rsquo;s quarters at six that evening.</p><p>News was received at the Emperor&rsquo;s quarters that very day of a fresh movement by Napoleon which might endanger the army&mdash;news subsequently found to be false. And that morning Colonel Michaud had ridden round the Drissa fortifications with the Emperor and had pointed out to him that this fortified camp constructed by Pfuel, and till then considered a chef-d&rsquo;oeuvre of tactical science which would ensure Napoleon&rsquo;s destruction, was an absurdity, threatening the destruction of the Russian army.</p>",
  "page-142": "<p>Prince Andrew arrived at Bennigsen&rsquo;s quarters&mdash;a country gentleman&rsquo;s house of moderate size, situated on the very banks of the river. Neither Bennigsen nor the Emperor was there, but Chernýshev, the Emperor&rsquo;s aide-de-camp, received Bolkónski and informed him that the Emperor, accompanied by General Bennigsen and Marquis Paulucci, had gone a second time that day to inspect the fortifications of the Drissa camp, of the suitability of which serious doubts were beginning to be felt.</p><p>Chernýshev was sitting at a window in the first room with a French novel in his hand. This room had probably been a music room; there was still an organ in it on which some rugs were piled, and in one corner stood the folding bedstead of Bennigsen&rsquo;s adjutant. This adjutant was also there and sat dozing on the rolled-up bedding, evidently exhausted by work or by feasting.</p>",
  "page-143": "<p> Two doors led from the room, one straight on into what had been the drawing room, and another, on the right, to the study. Through the first door came the sound of voices conversing in German and occasionally in French. In that drawing room were gathered, by the Emperor&rsquo;s wish, not a military council (the Emperor preferred indefiniteness), but certain persons whose opinions he wished to know in view of the impending difficulties. It was not a council of war, but, as it were, a council to elucidate certain questions for the Emperor personally. To this semicouncil had been invited the Swedish General Armfeldt, Adjutant General Wolzogen, Wintzingerode (whom Napoleon had referred to as a renegade French subject), Michaud, Toll, Count Stein who was not a military man at all, and Pfuel himself, who, as Prince Andrew had heard, was the mainspring of the whole affair.</p>",
  "page-144": "<p> Prince Andrew had an opportunity of getting a good look at him, for Pfuel arrived soon after himself and, in passing through to the drawing room, stopped a minute to speak to Chernýshev.</p><p>At first sight, Pfuel, in his ill-made uniform of a Russian general, which fitted him badly like a fancy costume, seemed familiar to Prince Andrew, though he saw him now for the first time. There was about him something of Weyrother, Mack, and Schmidt, and many other German theorist-generals whom Prince Andrew had seen in 1805, but he was more typical than any of them. Prince Andrew had never yet seen a German theorist in whom all the characteristics of those others were united to such an extent.</p>",
  "page-145": "<p>Pfuel was short and very thin but broad-boned, of coarse, robust build, broad in the hips, and with prominent shoulder blades. His face was much wrinkled and his eyes deep set. His hair had evidently been hastily brushed smooth in front of the temples, but stuck up behind in quaint little tufts. He entered the room, looking restlessly and angrily around, as if afraid of everything in that large apartment. Awkwardly holding up his sword, he addressed Chernýshev and asked in German where the Emperor was. One could see that he wished to pass through the rooms as quickly as possible, finish with the bows and greetings, and sit down to business in front of a map, where he would feel at home. He nodded hurriedly in reply to Chernýshev, and smiled ironically on hearing that the sovereign was inspecting the fortifications that he, Pfuel, had planned in accord with his theory.</p>",
  "page-146": "<p> He muttered something to himself abruptly and in a bass voice, as self-assured Germans do&mdash;it might have been &ldquo;stupid fellow&rdquo;... or &ldquo;the whole affair will be ruined,&rdquo; or &ldquo;something absurd will come of it.&rdquo;... Prince Andrew did not catch what he said and would have passed on, but Chernýshev introduced him to Pfuel, remarking that Prince Andrew was just back from Turkey where the war had terminated so fortunately. Pfuel barely glanced&mdash;not so much at Prince Andrew as past him&mdash;and said, with a laugh: &ldquo;That must have been a fine tactical war&rdquo;; and, laughing contemptuously, went on into the room from which the sound of voices was heard.</p><p>Pfuel, always inclined to be irritably sarcastic, was particularly disturbed that day, evidently by the fact that they had dared to inspect and criticize his camp in his absence.</p>",
  "page-147": "<p> From this short interview with Pfuel, Prince Andrew, thanks to his Austerlitz experiences, was able to form a clear conception of the man. Pfuel was one of those hopelessly and immutably self-confident men, self-confident to the point of martyrdom as only Germans are, because only Germans are self-confident on the basis of an abstract notion&mdash;science, that is, the supposed knowledge of absolute truth. A Frenchman is self-assured because he regards himself personally, both in mind and body, as irresistibly attractive to men and women. An Englishman is self-assured, as being a citizen of the best-organized state in the world, and therefore as an Englishman always knows what he should do and knows that all he does as an Englishman is undoubtedly correct. An Italian is self-assured because he is excitable and easily forgets himself and other people.</p>",
  "page-148": "<p> A Russian is self-assured just because he knows nothing and does not want to know anything, since he does not believe that anything can be known. The German&rsquo;s self-assurance is worst of all, stronger and more repulsive than any other, because he imagines that he knows the truth&mdash;science&mdash;which he himself has invented but which is for him the absolute truth.</p><p>Pfuel was evidently of that sort. He had a science&mdash;the theory of oblique movements deduced by him from the history of Frederick the Great&rsquo;s wars, and all he came across in the history of more recent warfare seemed to him absurd and barbarous&mdash;monstrous collisions in which so many blunders were committed by both sides that these wars could not be called wars, they did not accord with the theory, and therefore could not serve as material for science.</p>",
  "page-149": "<p>In 1806 Pfuel had been one of those responsible, for the plan of campaign that ended in Jena and Auerstädt, but he did not see the least proof of the fallibility of his theory in the disasters of that war. On the contrary, the deviations made from his theory were, in his opinion, the sole cause of the whole disaster, and with characteristically gleeful sarcasm he would remark, &ldquo;There, I said the whole affair would go to the devil!&rdquo; Pfuel was one of those theoreticians who so love their theory that they lose sight of the theory&rsquo;s object&mdash;its practical application. His love of theory made him hate everything practical, and he would not listen to it. He was even pleased by failures, for failures resulting from deviations in practice from the theory only proved to him the accuracy of his theory.</p>",
  "page-150": "<p>He said a few words to Prince Andrew and Chernýshev about the present war, with the air of a man who knows beforehand that all will go wrong, and who is not displeased that it should be so. The unbrushed tufts of hair sticking up behind and the hastily brushed hair on his temples expressed this most eloquently.</p><p>He passed into the next room, and the deep, querulous sounds of his voice were at once heard from there.</p>",
  "page-151": "<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>",
  "page-152": "<p>Prince Andrew&rsquo;s eyes were still following Pfuel out of the room when Count Bennigsen entered hurriedly, and nodding to Bolkónski, but not pausing, went into the study, giving instructions to his adjutant as he went. The Emperor was following him, and Bennigsen had hastened on to make some preparations and to be ready to receive the sovereign. Chernýshev and Prince Andrew went out into the porch, where the Emperor, who looked fatigued, was dismounting. Marquis Paulucci was talking to him with particular warmth and the Emperor, with his head bent to the left, was listening with a dissatisfied air. The Emperor moved forward evidently wishing to end the conversation, but the flushed and excited Italian, oblivious of decorum, followed him and continued to speak.</p>",
  "page-153": "<p>&ldquo;And as for the man who advised forming this camp&mdash;the Drissa camp,&rdquo; said Paulucci, as the Emperor mounted the steps and noticing Prince Andrew scanned his unfamiliar face, &ldquo;as to that person, sire...&rdquo; continued Paulucci, desperately, apparently unable to restrain himself, &ldquo;the man who advised the Drissa camp&mdash;I see no alternative but the lunatic asylum or the gallows!&rdquo;</p><p>Without heeding the end of the Italian&rsquo;s remarks, and as though not hearing them, the Emperor, recognizing Bolkónski, addressed him graciously.</p><p>&ldquo;I am very glad to see you! Go in there where they are meeting, and wait for me.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-154": "<p>The Emperor went into the study. He was followed by Prince Peter Mikháylovich Volkónski and Baron Stein, and the door closed behind them. Prince Andrew, taking advantage of the Emperor&rsquo;s permission, accompanied Paulucci, whom he had known in Turkey, into the drawing room where the council was assembled.</p><p>Prince Peter Mikháylovich Volkónski occupied the position, as it were, of chief of the Emperor&rsquo;s staff. He came out of the study into the drawing room with some maps which he spread on a table, and put questions on which he wished to hear the opinion of the gentlemen present. What had happened was that news (which afterwards proved to be false) had been received during the night of a movement by the French to outflank the Drissa camp.</p>",
  "page-155": "<p>The first to speak was General Armfeldt who, to meet the difficulty that presented itself, unexpectedly proposed a perfectly new position away from the Petersburg and Moscow roads. The reason for this was inexplicable (unless he wished to show that he, too, could have an opinion), but he urged that at this point the army should unite and there await the enemy. It was plain that Armfeldt had thought out that plan long ago and now expounded it not so much to answer the questions put&mdash;which, in fact, his plan did not answer&mdash;as to avail himself of the opportunity to air it. It was one of the millions of proposals, one as good as another, that could be made as long as it was quite unknown what character the war would take. Some disputed his arguments, others defended them.</p>",
  "page-156": "<p> Young Count Toll objected to the Swedish general&rsquo;s views more warmly than anyone else, and in the course of the dispute drew from his side pocket a well-filled notebook, which he asked permission to read to them. In these voluminous notes Toll suggested another scheme, totally different from Armfeldt&rsquo;s or Pfuel&rsquo;s plan of campaign. In answer to Toll, Paulucci suggested an advance and an attack, which, he urged, could alone extricate us from the present uncertainty and from the trap (as he called the Drissa camp) in which we were situated.</p><p>During all these discussions Pfuel and his interpreter, Wolzogen (his &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; in court relations), were silent. Pfuel only snorted contemptuously and turned away, to show that he would never demean himself by replying to such nonsense as he was now hearing.</p>",
  "page-157": "<p> So when Prince Volkónski, who was in the chair, called on him to give his opinion, he merely said:</p><p>&ldquo;Why ask me? General Armfeldt has proposed a splendid position with an exposed rear, or why not this Italian gentleman&rsquo;s attack&mdash;very fine, or a retreat, also good! Why ask me?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Why, you yourselves know everything better than I do.&rdquo;</p><p>But when Volkónski said, with a frown, that it was in the Emperor&rsquo;s name that he asked his opinion, Pfuel rose and, suddenly growing animated, began to speak:</p><p>&ldquo;Everything has been spoiled, everything muddled, everybody thought they knew better than I did, and now you come to me! How mend matters? There is nothing to mend! The principles laid down by me must be strictly adhered to,&rdquo; said he, drumming on the table with his bony fingers. &ldquo;What is the difficulty? Nonsense, childishness!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-158": "<p>He went up to the map and speaking rapidly began proving that no eventuality could alter the efficiency of the Drissa camp, that everything had been foreseen, and that if the enemy were really going to outflank it, the enemy would inevitably be destroyed.</p><p>Paulucci, who did not know German, began questioning him in French. Wolzogen came to the assistance of his chief, who spoke French badly, and began translating for him, hardly able to keep pace with Pfuel, who was rapidly demonstrating that not only all that had happened, but all that could happen, had been foreseen in his scheme, and that if there were now any difficulties the whole fault lay in the fact that his plan had not been precisely executed. He kept laughing sarcastically, he demonstrated, and at last contemptuously ceased to demonstrate, like a mathematician who ceases to prove in various ways the accuracy of a problem that has already been proved.</p>",
  "page-159": "<p> Wolzogen took his place and continued to explain his views in French, every now and then turning to Pfuel and saying, &ldquo;Is it not so, your excellency?&rdquo; But Pfuel, like a man heated in a fight who strikes those on his own side, shouted angrily at his own supporter, Wolzogen:</p><p>&ldquo;Well, of course, what more is there to explain?&rdquo;</p><p>Paulucci and Michaud both attacked Wolzogen simultaneously in French. Armfeldt addressed Pfuel in German. Toll explained to Volkónski in Russian. Prince Andrew listened and observed in silence.</p><p>Of all these men Prince Andrew sympathized most with Pfuel, angry, determined, and absurdly self-confident as he was. Of all those present, evidently he alone was not seeking anything for himself, nursed no hatred against anyone, and only desired that the plan, formed on a theory arrived at by years of toil, should be carried out.</p>",
  "page-160": "<p> He was ridiculous, and unpleasantly sarcastic, but yet he inspired involuntary respect by his boundless devotion to an idea. Besides this, the remarks of all except Pfuel had one common trait that had not been noticeable at the council of war in 1805: there was now a panic fear of Napoleon&rsquo;s genius, which, though concealed, was noticeable in every rejoinder. Everything was assumed to be possible for Napoleon, they expected him from every side, and invoked his terrible name to shatter each other&rsquo;s proposals. Pfuel alone seemed to consider Napoleon a barbarian like everyone else who opposed his theory. But besides this feeling of respect, Pfuel evoked pity in Prince Andrew. From the tone in which the courtiers addressed him and the way Paulucci had allowed himself to speak of him to the Emperor, but above all from a certain desperation in Pfuel&rsquo;</p>",
  "page-161": "<p>s own expressions, it was clear that the others knew, and Pfuel himself felt, that his fall was at hand. And despite his self-confidence and grumpy German sarcasm he was pitiable, with his hair smoothly brushed on the temples and sticking up in tufts behind. Though he concealed the fact under a show of irritation and contempt, he was evidently in despair that the sole remaining chance of verifying his theory by a huge experiment and proving its soundness to the whole world was slipping away from him.</p><p>The discussions continued a long time, and the longer they lasted the more heated became the disputes, culminating in shouts and personalities, and the less was it possible to arrive at any general conclusion from all that had been said. Prince Andrew, listening to this polyglot talk and to these surmises, plans, refutations, and shouts, felt nothing but amazement at what they were saying.</p>",
  "page-162": "<p> A thought that had long since and often occurred to him during his military activities&mdash;the idea that there is not and cannot be any science of war, and that therefore there can be no such thing as a military genius&mdash;now appeared to him an obvious truth. &ldquo;What theory and science is possible about a matter the conditions and circumstances of which are unknown and cannot be defined, especially when the strength of the acting forces cannot be ascertained? No one was or is able to foresee in what condition our or the enemy&rsquo;s armies will be in a day&rsquo;s time, and no one can gauge the force of this or that detachment. Sometimes&mdash;when there is not a coward at the front to shout, &lsquo;We are cut off!&rsquo; and start running, but a brave and jolly lad who shouts, &lsquo;Hurrah!&rsquo;&mdash;</p>",
  "page-163": "<p>a detachment of five thousand is worth thirty thousand, as at Schön Grabern, while at times fifty thousand run from eight thousand, as at Austerlitz. What science can there be in a matter in which, as in all practical matters, nothing can be defined and everything depends on innumerable conditions, the significance of which is determined at a particular moment which arrives no one knows when? Armfeldt says our army is cut in half, and Paulucci says we have got the French army between two fires; Michaud says that the worthlessness of the Drissa camp lies in having the river behind it, and Pfuel says that is what constitutes its strength; Toll proposes one plan, Armfeldt another, and they are all good and all bad, and the advantages of any suggestions can be seen only at the moment of trial.</p>",
  "page-164": "<p> And why do they all speak of a &lsquo;military genius&rsquo;? Is a man a genius who can order bread to be brought up at the right time and say who is to go to the right and who to the left? It is only because military men are invested with pomp and power and crowds of sychophants flatter power, attributing to it qualities of genius it does not possess. The best generals I have known were, on the contrary, stupid or absent-minded men. Bagratión was the best, Napoleon himself admitted that. And of Bonaparte himself! I remember his limited, self-satisfied face on the field of Austerlitz. Not only does a good army commander not need any special qualities, on the contrary he needs the absence of the highest and best human attributes&mdash;love, poetry, tenderness, and philosophic inquiring doubt.</p>",
  "page-165": "<p> He should be limited, firmly convinced that what he is doing is very important (otherwise he will not have sufficient patience), and only then will he be a brave leader. God forbid that he should be humane, should love, or pity, or think of what is just and unjust. It is understandable that a theory of their &lsquo;genius&rsquo; was invented for them long ago because they have power! The success of a military action depends not on them, but on the man in the ranks who shouts, &lsquo;We are lost!&rsquo; or who shouts, &lsquo;Hurrah!&rsquo; And only in the ranks can one serve with assurance of being useful.&rdquo;</p><p>So thought Prince Andrew as he listened to the talking, and he roused himself only when Paulucci called him and everyone was leaving.</p>",
  "page-166": "<p>At the review next day the Emperor asked Prince Andrew where he would like to serve, and Prince Andrew lost his standing in court circles forever by not asking to remain attached to the sovereign&rsquo;s person, but for permission to serve in the army.</p>",
  "page-167": "<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>",
  "page-168": "<p>Before the beginning of the campaign, Rostóv had received a letter from his parents in which they told him briefly of Natásha&rsquo;s illness and the breaking off of her engagement to Prince Andrew (which they explained by Natásha&rsquo;s having rejected him) and again asked Nicholas to retire from the army and return home. On receiving this letter, Nicholas did not even make any attempt to get leave of absence or to retire from the army, but wrote to his parents that he was sorry Natásha was ill and her engagement broken off, and that he would do all he could to meet their wishes. To Sónya he wrote separately.</p><p>&ldquo;Adored friend of my soul!&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Nothing but honor could keep me from returning to the country.</p>",
  "page-169": "<p> But now, at the commencement of the campaign, I should feel dishonored, not only in my comrades&rsquo; eyes but in my own, if I preferred my own happiness to my love and duty to the Fatherland. But this shall be our last separation. Believe me, directly the war is over, if I am still alive and still loved by you, I will throw up everything and fly to you, to press you forever to my ardent breast.&rdquo;</p><p>It was, in fact, only the commencement of the campaign that prevented Rostóv from returning home as he had promised and marrying Sónya. The autumn in Otrádnoe with the hunting, and the winter with the Christmas holidays and Sónya&rsquo;s love, had opened out to him a vista of tranquil rural joys and peace such as he had never known before, and which now allured him.</p>",
  "page-170": "<p> &ldquo;A splendid wife, children, a good pack of hounds, a dozen leashes of smart borzois, agriculture, neighbors, service by election...&rdquo; thought he. But now the campaign was beginning, and he had to remain with his regiment. And since it had to be so, Nicholas Rostóv, as was natural to him, felt contented with the life he led in the regiment and was able to find pleasure in that life.</p><p>On his return from his furlough Nicholas, having been joyfully welcomed by his comrades, was sent to obtain remounts and brought back from the Ukraine excellent horses which pleased him and earned him commendation from his commanders. During his absence he had been promoted captain, and when the regiment was put on war footing with an increase in numbers, he was again allotted his old squadron.</p>",
  "page-171": "<p>The campaign began, the regiment was moved into Poland on double pay, new officers arrived, new men and horses, and above all everybody was infected with the merrily excited mood that goes with the commencement of a war, and Rostóv, conscious of his advantageous position in the regiment, devoted himself entirely to the pleasures and interests of military service, though he knew that sooner or later he would have to relinquish them.</p><p>The troops retired from Vílna for various complicated reasons of state, political and strategic. Each step of the retreat was accompanied by a complicated interplay of interests, arguments, and passions at headquarters. For the Pávlograd hussars, however, the whole of this retreat during the finest period of summer and with sufficient supplies was a very simple and agreeable business.</p>",
  "page-172": "<p>It was only at headquarters that there was depression, uneasiness, and intriguing; in the body of the army they did not ask themselves where they were going or why. If they regretted having to retreat, it was only because they had to leave billets they had grown accustomed to, or some pretty young Polish lady. If the thought that things looked bad chanced to enter anyone&rsquo;s head, he tried to be as cheerful as befits a good soldier and not to think of the general trend of affairs, but only of the task nearest to hand. First they camped gaily before Vílna, making acquaintance with the Polish landowners, preparing for reviews and being reviewed by the Emperor and other high commanders. Then came an order to retreat to Sventsyáni and destroy any provisions they could not carry away with them.</p>",
  "page-173": "<p> Sventsyáni was remembered by the hussars only as the drunken camp, a name the whole army gave to their encampment there, and because many complaints were made against the troops, who, taking advantage of the order to collect provisions, took also horses, carriages, and carpets from the Polish proprietors. Rostóv remembered Sventsyáni, because on the first day of their arrival at that small town he changed his sergeant major and was unable to manage all the drunken men of his squadron who, unknown to him, had appropriated five barrels of old beer. From Sventsyáni they retired farther and farther to Drissa, and thence again beyond Drissa, drawing near to the frontier of Russia proper.</p><p>On the thirteenth of July the Pávlograds took part in a serious action for the first time.</p>",
  "page-174": "<p>On the twelfth of July, on the eve of that action, there was a heavy storm of rain and hail. In general, the summer of 1812 was remarkable for its storms.</p><p>The two Pávlograd squadrons were bivouacking on a field of rye, which was already in ear but had been completely trodden down by cattle and horses. The rain was descending in torrents, and Rostóv, with a young officer named Ilyín, his protégé, was sitting in a hastily constructed shelter. An officer of their regiment, with long mustaches extending onto his cheeks, who after riding to the staff had been overtaken by the rain, entered Rostóv&rsquo;s shelter.</p><p>&ldquo;I have come from the staff, Count. Have you heard of Raévski&rsquo;s exploit?&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-175": "<p>And the officer gave them details of the Saltánov battle, which he had heard at the staff.</p><p>Rostóv, smoking his pipe and turning his head about as the water trickled down his neck, listened inattentively, with an occasional glance at Ilyín, who was pressing close to him. This officer, a lad of sixteen who had recently joined the regiment, was now in the same relation to Nicholas that Nicholas had been to Denísov seven years before. Ilyín tried to imitate Rostóv in everything and adored him as a girl might have done.</p><p>Zdrzhinski, the officer with the long mustache, spoke grandiloquently of the Saltánov dam being &ldquo;a Russian Thermopylae,&rdquo; and of how a deed worthy of antiquity had been performed by General Raévski. He recounted how Raévski had led his two sons onto the dam under terrific fire and had charged with them beside him.</p>",
  "page-176": "<p> Rostóv heard the story and not only said nothing to encourage Zdrzhinski&rsquo;s enthusiasm but, on the contrary, looked like a man ashamed of what he was hearing, though with no intention of contradicting it. Since the campaigns of Austerlitz and of 1807 Rostóv knew by experience that men always lie when describing military exploits, as he himself had done when recounting them; besides that, he had experience enough to know that nothing happens in war at all as we can imagine or relate it. And so he did not like Zdrzhinski&rsquo;s tale, nor did he like Zdrzhinski himself who, with his mustaches extending over his cheeks, bent low over the face of his hearer, as was his habit, and crowded Rostóv in the narrow shanty. Rostóv looked at him in silence.</p>",
  "page-177": "<p> &ldquo;In the first place, there must have been such a confusion and crowding on the dam that was being attacked that if Raévski did lead his sons there, it could have had no effect except perhaps on some dozen men nearest to him,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;the rest could not have seen how or with whom Raévski came onto the dam. And even those who did see it would not have been much stimulated by it, for what had they to do with Raévski&rsquo;s tender paternal feelings when their own skins were in danger? And besides, the fate of the Fatherland did not depend on whether they took the Saltánov dam or not, as we are told was the case at Thermopylae. So why should he have made such a sacrifice? And why expose his own children in the battle? I would not have taken my brother Pétya there, or even Ilyín, who&rsquo;s a stranger to me but a nice lad, but would have tried to put them somewhere under cover,&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-178": "<p> Nicholas continued to think, as he listened to Zdrzhinski. But he did not express his thoughts, for in such matters, too, he had gained experience. He knew that this tale redounded to the glory of our arms and so one had to pretend not to doubt it. And he acted accordingly.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand this any more,&rdquo; said Ilyín, noticing that Rostóv did not relish Zdrzhinski&rsquo;s conversation. &ldquo;My stockings and shirt... and the water is running on my seat! I&rsquo;ll go and look for shelter. The rain seems less heavy.&rdquo;</p><p>Ilyín went out and Zdrzhinski rode away.</p><p>Five minutes later Ilyín, splashing through the mud, came running back to the shanty.</p>",
  "page-179": "<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! Rostóv, come quick! I&rsquo;ve found it! About two hundred yards away there&rsquo;s a tavern where ours have already gathered. We can at least get dry there, and Mary Hendríkhovna&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;</p><p>Mary Hendríkhovna was the wife of the regimental doctor, a pretty young German woman he had married in Poland. The doctor, whether from lack of means or because he did not like to part from his young wife in the early days of their marriage, took her about with him wherever the hussar regiment went and his jealousy had become a standing joke among the hussar officers.</p><p>Rostóv threw his cloak over his shoulders, shouted to Lavrúshka to follow with the things, and&mdash;now slipping in the mud, now splashing right through it&mdash;set off with Ilyín in the lessening rain and the darkness that was occasionally rent by distant lightning.</p>",
  "page-180": "<p>&ldquo;Rostóv, where are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here. What lightning!&rdquo; they called to one another.</p>",
  "page-181": "<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>",
  "page-182": "<p>In the tavern, before which stood the doctor&rsquo;s covered cart, there were already some five officers. Mary Hendríkhovna, a plump little blonde German, in a dressing jacket and nightcap, was sitting on a broad bench in the front corner. Her husband, the doctor, lay asleep behind her. Rostóv and Ilyín, on entering the room, were welcomed with merry shouts and laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;Dear me, how jolly we are!&rdquo; said Rostóv laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;And why do you stand there gaping?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What swells they are! Why, the water streams from them! Don&rsquo;t make our drawing room so wet.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-183": "<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mess Mary Hendríkhovna&rsquo;s dress!&rdquo; cried other voices.</p><p>Rostóv and Ilyín hastened to find a corner where they could change into dry clothes without offending Mary Hendríkhovna&rsquo;s modesty. They were going into a tiny recess behind a partition to change, but found it completely filled by three officers who sat playing cards by the light of a solitary candle on an empty box, and these officers would on no account yield their position. Mary Hendríkhovna obliged them with the loan of a petticoat to be used as a curtain, and behind that screen Rostóv and Ilyín, helped by Lavrúshka who had brought their kits, changed their wet things for dry ones.</p>",
  "page-184": "<p>A fire was made up in the dilapidated brick stove. A board was found, fixed on two saddles and covered with a horsecloth, a small samovar was produced and a cellaret and half a bottle of rum, and having asked Mary Hendríkhovna to preside, they all crowded round her. One offered her a clean handkerchief to wipe her charming hands, another spread a jacket under her little feet to keep them from the damp, another hung his coat over the window to keep out the draft, and yet another waved the flies off her husband&rsquo;s face, lest he should wake up.</p><p>&ldquo;Leave him alone,&rdquo; said Mary Hendríkhovna, smiling timidly and happily. &ldquo;He is sleeping well as it is, after a sleepless night.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-185": "<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Mary Hendríkhovna,&rdquo; replied the officer, &ldquo;one must look after the doctor. Perhaps he&rsquo;ll take pity on me someday, when it comes to cutting off a leg or an arm for me.&rdquo;</p><p>There were only three tumblers, the water was so muddy that one could not make out whether the tea was strong or weak, and the samovar held only six tumblers of water, but this made it all the pleasanter to take turns in order of seniority to receive one&rsquo;s tumbler from Mary Hendríkhovna&rsquo;s plump little hands with their short and not overclean nails. All the officers appeared to be, and really were, in love with her that evening. Even those playing cards behind the partition soon left their game and came over to the samovar, yielding to the general mood of courting Mary Hendríkhovna.</p>",
  "page-186": "<p> She, seeing herself surrounded by such brilliant and polite young men, beamed with satisfaction, try as she might to hide it, and perturbed as she evidently was each time her husband moved in his sleep behind her.</p><p>There was only one spoon, sugar was more plentiful than anything else, but it took too long to dissolve, so it was decided that Mary Hendríkhovna should stir the sugar for everyone in turn. Rostóv received his tumbler, and adding some rum to it asked Mary Hendríkhovna to stir it.</p><p>&ldquo;But you take it without sugar?&rdquo; she said, smiling all the time, as if everything she said and everything the others said was very amusing and had a double meaning.</p>",
  "page-187": "<p>&ldquo;It is not the sugar I want, but only that your little hand should stir my tea.&rdquo;</p><p>Mary Hendríkhovna assented and began looking for the spoon which someone meanwhile had pounced on.</p><p>&ldquo;Use your finger, Mary Hendríkhovna, it will be still nicer,&rdquo; said Rostóv.</p><p>&ldquo;Too hot!&rdquo; she replied, blushing with pleasure.</p><p>Ilyín put a few drops of rum into the bucket of water and brought it to Mary Hendríkhovna, asking her to stir it with her finger.</p><p>&ldquo;This is my cup,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Only dip your finger in it and I&rsquo;ll drink it all up.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-188": "<p>When they had emptied the samovar, Rostóv took a pack of cards and proposed that they should play &ldquo;Kings&rdquo; with Mary Hendríkhovna. They drew lots to settle who should make up her set. At Rostóv&rsquo;s suggestion it was agreed that whoever became &ldquo;King&rdquo; should have the right to kiss Mary Hendríkhovna&rsquo;s hand, and that the &ldquo;Booby&rdquo; should go to refill and reheat the samovar for the doctor when the latter awoke.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, but supposing Mary Hendríkhovna is &lsquo;King&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Ilyín.</p><p>&ldquo;As it is, she is Queen, and her word is law!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-189": "<p>They had hardly begun to play before the doctor&rsquo;s disheveled head suddenly appeared from behind Mary Hendríkhovna. He had been awake for some time, listening to what was being said, and evidently found nothing entertaining or amusing in what was going on. His face was sad and depressed. Without greeting the officers, he scratched himself and asked to be allowed to pass as they were blocking the way. As soon as he had left the room all the officers burst into loud laughter and Mary Hendríkhovna blushed till her eyes filled with tears and thereby became still more attractive to them. Returning from the yard, the doctor told his wife (who had ceased to smile so happily, and looked at him in alarm, awaiting her sentence) that the rain had ceased and they must go to sleep in their covered cart, or everything in it would be stolen.</p>",
  "page-190": "<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll send an orderly.... Two of them!&rdquo; said Rostóv. &ldquo;What an idea, doctor!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stand guard on it myself!&rdquo; said Ilyín.</p><p>&ldquo;No, gentlemen, you have had your sleep, but I have not slept for two nights,&rdquo; replied the doctor, and he sat down morosely beside his wife, waiting for the game to end.</p><p>Seeing his gloomy face as he frowned at his wife, the officers grew still merrier, and some of them could not refrain from laughter, for which they hurriedly sought plausible pretexts. When he had gone, taking his wife with him, and had settled down with her in their covered cart, the officers lay down in the tavern, covering themselves with their wet cloaks, but they did not sleep for a long time; now they exchanged remarks, recalling the doctor&rsquo;s uneasiness and his wife&rsquo;</p>",
  "page-191": "<p>s delight, now they ran out into the porch and reported what was taking place in the covered trap. Several times Rostóv, covering his head, tried to go to sleep, but some remark would arouse him and conversation would be resumed, to the accompaniment of unreasoning, merry, childlike laughter.</p>",
  "page-192": "<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>",
  "page-193": "<p>It was nearly three o&rsquo;clock but no one was yet asleep, when the quartermaster appeared with an order to move on to the little town of Ostróvna. Still laughing and talking, the officers began hurriedly getting ready and again boiled some muddy water in the samovar. But Rostóv went off to his squadron without waiting for tea. Day was breaking, the rain had ceased, and the clouds were dispersing. It felt damp and cold, especially in clothes that were still moist. As they left the tavern in the twilight of the dawn, Rostóv and Ilyín both glanced under the wet and glistening leather hood of the doctor&rsquo;s cart, from under the apron of which his feet were sticking out, and in the middle of which his wife&rsquo;s nightcap was visible and her sleepy breathing audible.</p>",
  "page-194": "<p>&ldquo;She really is a dear little thing,&rdquo; said Rostóv to Ilyín, who was following him.</p><p>&ldquo;A charming woman!&rdquo; said Ilyín, with all the gravity of a boy of sixteen.</p><p>Half an hour later the squadron was lined up on the road. The command was heard to &ldquo;mount&rdquo; and the soldiers crossed themselves and mounted. Rostóv riding in front gave the order &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; and the hussars, with clanking sabers and subdued talk, their horses&rsquo; hoofs splashing in the mud, defiled in fours and moved along the broad road planted with birch trees on each side, following the infantry and a battery that had gone on in front.</p>",
  "page-195": "<p>Tattered, blue-purple clouds, reddening in the east, were scudding before the wind. It was growing lighter and lighter. That curly grass which always grows by country roadsides became clearly visible, still wet with the night&rsquo;s rain; the drooping branches of the birches, also wet, swayed in the wind and flung down bright drops of water to one side. The soldiers&rsquo; faces were more and more clearly visible. Rostóv, always closely followed by Ilyín, rode along the side of the road between two rows of birch trees.</p><p>When campaigning, Rostóv allowed himself the indulgence of riding not a regimental but a Cossack horse. A judge of horses and a sportsman, he had lately procured himself a large, fine, mettlesome, Donéts horse, dun-colored, with light mane and tail, and when he rode it no one could outgallop him.</p>",
  "page-196": "<p> To ride this horse was a pleasure to him, and he thought of the horse, of the morning, of the doctor&rsquo;s wife, but not once of the impending danger.</p><p>Formerly, when going into action, Rostóv had felt afraid; now he had not the least feeling of fear. He was fearless, not because he had grown used to being under fire (one cannot grow used to danger), but because he had learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger. He had grown accustomed when going into action to think about anything but what would seem most likely to interest him&mdash;the impending danger. During the first period of his service, hard as he tried and much as he reproached himself with cowardice, he had not been able to do this, but with time it had come of itself.</p>",
  "page-197": "<p> Now he rode beside Ilyín under the birch trees, occasionally plucking leaves from a branch that met his hand, sometimes touching his horse&rsquo;s side with his foot, or, without turning round, handing a pipe he had finished to an hussar riding behind him, with as calm and careless an air as though he were merely out for a ride. He glanced with pity at the excited face of Ilyín, who talked much and in great agitation. He knew from experience the tormenting expectation of terror and death the cornet was suffering and knew that only time could help him.</p><p>As soon as the sun appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath the clouds, the wind fell, as if it dared not spoil the beauty of the summer morning after the storm; drops still continued to fall, but vertically now, and all was still.</p>",
  "page-198": "<p> The whole sun appeared on the horizon and disappeared behind a long narrow cloud that hung above it. A few minutes later it reappeared brighter still from behind the top of the cloud, tearing its edge. Everything grew bright and glittered. And with that light, and as if in reply to it, came the sound of guns ahead of them.</p><p>Before Rostóv had had time to consider and determine the distance of that firing, Count Ostermann-Tolstóy&rsquo;s adjutant came galloping from Vítebsk with orders to advance at a trot along the road.</p><p>The squadron overtook and passed the infantry and the battery&mdash;which had also quickened their pace&mdash;rode down a hill, and passing through an empty and deserted village again ascended. The horses began to lather and the men to flush.</p>",
  "page-199": "<p>&ldquo;Halt! Dress your ranks!&rdquo; the order of the regimental commander was heard ahead. &ldquo;Forward by the left. Walk, march!&rdquo; came the order from in front.</p><p>And the hussars, passing along the line of troops on the left flank of our position, halted behind our Uhlans who were in the front line. To the right stood our infantry in a dense column: they were the reserve. Higher up the hill, on the very horizon, our guns were visible through the wonderfully clear air, brightly illuminated by slanting morning sunbeams. In front, beyond a hollow dale, could be seen the enemy&rsquo;s columns and guns. Our advanced line, already in action, could be heard briskly exchanging shots with the enemy in the dale.</p>",
  "page-200": "<p>At these sounds, long unheard, Rostóv&rsquo;s spirits rose, as at the strains of the merriest music. Trap-ta-ta-tap! cracked the shots, now together, now several quickly one after another. Again all was silent and then again it sounded as if someone were walking on detonators and exploding them.</p><p>The hussars remained in the same place for about an hour. A cannonade began. Count Ostermann with his suite rode up behind the squadron, halted, spoke to the commander of the regiment, and rode up the hill to the guns.</p><p>After Ostermann had gone, a command rang out to the Uhlans.</p>",
  "page-201": "<p>&ldquo;Form column! Prepare to charge!&rdquo;</p><p>The infantry in front of them parted into platoons to allow the cavalry to pass. The Uhlans started, the streamers on their spears fluttering, and trotted downhill toward the French cavalry which was seen below to the left.</p><p>As soon as the Uhlans descended the hill, the hussars were ordered up the hill to support the battery. As they took the places vacated by the Uhlans, bullets came from the front, whining and whistling, but fell spent without taking effect.</p><p>The sounds, which he had not heard for so long, had an even more pleasurable and exhilarating effect on Rostóv than the previous sounds of firing. Drawing himself up, he viewed the field of battle opening out before him from the hill, and with his whole soul followed the movement of the Uhlans.</p>",
  "page-202": "<p> They swooped down close to the French dragoons, something confused happened there amid the smoke, and five minutes later our Uhlans were galloping back, not to the place they had occupied but more to the left, and among the orange-colored Uhlans on chestnut horses and behind them, in a large group, blue French dragoons on gray horses could be seen.</p>",
  "page-203": "<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>",
  "page-204": "<p>Rostóv, with his keen sportsman&rsquo;s eye, was one of the first to catch sight of these blue French dragoons pursuing our Uhlans. Nearer and nearer in disorderly crowds came the Uhlans and the French dragoons pursuing them. He could already see how these men, who looked so small at the foot of the hill, jostled and overtook one another, waving their arms and their sabers in the air.</p><p>Rostóv gazed at what was happening before him as at a hunt. He felt instinctively that if the hussars struck at the French dragoons now, the latter could not withstand them, but if a charge was to be made it must be done now, at that very moment, or it would be too late. He looked around. A captain, standing beside him, was gazing like himself with eyes fixed on the cavalry below them.</p>",
  "page-205": "<p>&ldquo;Andrew Sevastyánych!&rdquo; said Rostóv. &ldquo;You know, we could crush them....&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A fine thing too!&rdquo; replied the captain, &ldquo;and really...&rdquo;</p><p>Rostóv, without waiting to hear him out, touched his horse, galloped to the front of his squadron, and before he had time to finish giving the word of command, the whole squadron, sharing his feeling, was following him. Rostóv himself did not know how or why he did it. He acted as he did when hunting, without reflecting or considering. He saw the dragoons near and that they were galloping in disorder; he knew they could not withstand an attack&mdash;knew there was only that moment and that if he let it slip it would not return. The bullets were whining and whistling so stimulatingly around him and his horse was so eager to go that he could not restrain himself.</p>",
  "page-206": "<p> He touched his horse, gave the word of command, and immediately, hearing behind him the tramp of the horses of his deployed squadron, rode at full trot downhill toward the dragoons. Hardly had they reached the bottom of the hill before their pace instinctively changed to a gallop, which grew faster and faster as they drew nearer to our Uhlans and the French dragoons who galloped after them. The dragoons were now close at hand. On seeing the hussars, the foremost began to turn, while those behind began to halt. With the same feeling with which he had galloped across the path of a wolf, Rostóv gave rein to his Donéts horse and galloped to intersect the path of the dragoons&rsquo; disordered lines. One Uhlan stopped, another who was on foot flung himself to the ground to avoid being knocked over, and a riderless horse fell in among the hussars. Nearly all the French dragoons were galloping back.</p>",
  "page-207": "<p> Rostóv, picking out one on a gray horse, dashed after him. On the way he came upon a bush, his gallant horse cleared it, and almost before he had righted himself in his saddle he saw that he would immediately overtake the enemy he had selected. That Frenchman, by his uniform an officer, was going at a gallop, crouching on his gray horse and urging it on with his saber. In another moment Rostóv&rsquo;s horse dashed its breast against the hindquarters of the officer&rsquo;s horse, almost knocking it over, and at the same instant Rostóv, without knowing why, raised his saber and struck the Frenchman with it.</p><p>The instant he had done this, all Rostóv&rsquo;s animation vanished. The officer fell, not so much from the blow&mdash;which had but slightly cut his arm above the elbow&mdash;as from the shock to his horse and from fright.</p>",
  "page-208": "<p> Rostóv reined in his horse, and his eyes sought his foe to see whom he had vanquished. The French dragoon officer was hopping with one foot on the ground, the other being caught in the stirrup. His eyes, screwed up with fear as if he every moment expected another blow, gazed up at Rostóv with shrinking terror. His pale and mud-stained face&mdash;fair and young, with a dimple in the chin and light-blue eyes&mdash;was not an enemy&rsquo;s face at all suited to a battlefield, but a most ordinary, homelike face. Before Rostóv had decided what to do with him, the officer cried, &ldquo;I surrender!&rdquo; He hurriedly but vainly tried to get his foot out of the stirrup and did not remove his frightened blue eyes from Rostóv&rsquo;s face. Some hussars who galloped up disengaged his foot and helped him into the saddle.</p>",
  "page-209": "<p> On all sides, the hussars were busy with the dragoons; one was wounded, but though his face was bleeding, he would not give up his horse; another was perched up behind an hussar with his arms round him; a third was being helped by an hussar to mount his horse. In front, the French infantry were firing as they ran. The hussars galloped hastily back with their prisoners. Rostóv galloped back with the rest, aware of an unpleasant feeling of depression in his heart. Something vague and confused, which he could not at all account for, had come over him with the capture of that officer and the blow he had dealt him.</p><p>Count Ostermann-Tolstóy met the returning hussars, sent for Rostóv, thanked him, and said he would report his gallant deed to the Emperor and would recommend him for a St. George&rsquo;s Cross.</p>",
  "page-210": "<p> When sent for by Count Ostermann, Rostóv, remembering that he had charged without orders, felt sure his commander was sending for him to punish him for breach of discipline. Ostermann&rsquo;s flattering words and promise of a reward should therefore have struck him all the more pleasantly, but he still felt that same vaguely disagreeable feeling of moral nausea. &ldquo;But what on earth is worrying me?&rdquo; he asked himself as he rode back from the general. &ldquo;Ilyín? No, he&rsquo;s safe. Have I disgraced myself in any way? No, that&rsquo;s not it.&rdquo; Something else, resembling remorse, tormented him. &ldquo;Yes, oh yes, that French officer with the dimple. And I remember how my arm paused when I raised it.&rdquo;</p><p>Rostóv saw the prisoners being led away and galloped after them to have a look at his Frenchman with the dimple on his chin.</p>",
  "page-211": "<p> He was sitting in his foreign uniform on an hussar packhorse and looked anxiously about him. The sword cut on his arm could scarcely be called a wound. He glanced at Rostóv with a feigned smile and waved his hand in greeting. Rostóv still had the same indefinite feeling, as of shame.</p><p>All that day and the next his friends and comrades noticed that Rostóv, without being dull or angry, was silent, thoughtful, and preoccupied. He drank reluctantly, tried to remain alone, and kept turning something over in his mind.</p><p>Rostóv was always thinking about that brilliant exploit of his, which to his amazement had gained him the St. George&rsquo;s Cross and even given him a reputation for bravery, and there was something he could not at all understand. &ldquo;So others are even more afraid than I am!&rdquo; he thought.</p>",
  "page-212": "<p> &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s all there is in what is called heroism! And did I do it for my country&rsquo;s sake? And how was he to blame, with his dimple and blue eyes? And how frightened he was! He thought that I should kill him. Why should I kill him? My hand trembled. And they have given me a St. George&rsquo;s Cross.... I can&rsquo;t make it out at all.&rdquo;</p><p>But while Nicholas was considering these questions and still could reach no clear solution of what puzzled him so, the wheel of fortune in the service, as often happens, turned in his favor. After the affair at Ostróvna he was brought into notice, received command of an hussar battalion, and when a brave officer was needed he was chosen.</p>",
  "page-213": "<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>",
  "page-214": "<p>On receiving news of Natásha&rsquo;s illness, the countess, though not quite well yet and still weak, went to Moscow with Pétya and the rest of the household, and the whole family moved from Márya Dmítrievna&rsquo;s house to their own and settled down in town.</p><p>Natásha&rsquo;s illness was so serious that, fortunately for her and for her parents, the consideration of all that had caused the illness, her conduct and the breaking off of her engagement, receded into the background. She was so ill that it was impossible for them to consider in how far she was to blame for what had happened. She could not eat or sleep, grew visibly thinner, coughed, and, as the doctors made them feel, was in danger. They could not think of anything but how to help her.</p>",
  "page-215": "<p> Doctors came to see her singly and in consultation, talked much in French, German, and Latin, blamed one another, and prescribed a great variety of medicines for all the diseases known to them, but the simple idea never occurred to any of them that they could not know the disease Natásha was suffering from, as no disease suffered by a live man can be known, for every living person has his own peculiarities and always has his own peculiar, personal, novel, complicated disease, unknown to medicine&mdash;not a disease of the lungs, liver, skin, heart, nerves, and so on mentioned in medical books, but a disease consisting of one of the innumerable combinations of the maladies of those organs. This simple thought could not occur to the doctors (as it cannot occur to a wizard that he is unable to work his charms) because the business of their lives was to cure, and they received money for it and had spent the best years of their lives on that business.</p>",
  "page-216": "<p> But, above all, that thought was kept out of their minds by the fact that they saw they were really useful, as in fact they were to the whole Rostóv family. Their usefulness did not depend on making the patient swallow substances for the most part harmful (the harm was scarcely perceptible, as they were given in small doses), but they were useful, necessary, and indispensable because they satisfied a mental need of the invalid and of those who loved her&mdash;and that is why there are, and always will be, pseudo-healers, wise women, homeopaths, and allopaths. They satisfied that eternal human need for hope of relief, for sympathy, and that something should be done, which is felt by those who are suffering. They satisfied the need seen in its most elementary form in a child, when it wants to have a place rubbed that has been hurt.</p>",
  "page-217": "<p> A child knocks itself and runs at once to the arms of its mother or nurse to have the aching spot rubbed or kissed, and it feels better when this is done. The child cannot believe that the strongest and wisest of its people have no remedy for its pain, and the hope of relief and the expression of its mother&rsquo;s sympathy while she rubs the bump comforts it. The doctors were of use to Natásha because they kissed and rubbed her bump, assuring her that it would soon pass if only the coachman went to the chemist&rsquo;s in the Arbát and got a powder and some pills in a pretty box for a ruble and seventy kopeks, and if she took those powders in boiled water at intervals of precisely two hours, neither more nor less.</p>",
  "page-218": "<p>What would Sónya and the count and countess have done, how would they have looked, if nothing had been done, if there had not been those pills to give by the clock, the warm drinks, the chicken cutlets, and all the other details of life ordered by the doctors, the carrying out of which supplied an occupation and consolation to the family circle? How would the count have borne his dearly loved daughter&rsquo;s illness had he not known that it was costing him a thousand rubles, and that he would not grudge thousands more to benefit her, or had he not known that if her illness continued he would not grudge yet other thousands and would take her abroad for consultations there, and had he not been able to explain the details of how Métivier and Feller had not understood the symptoms, but Frise had, and Múdrov had diagnosed them even better?</p>",
  "page-219": "<p> What would the countess have done had she not been able sometimes to scold the invalid for not strictly obeying the doctor&rsquo;s orders?</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never get well like that,&rdquo; she would say, forgetting her grief in her vexation, &ldquo;if you won&rsquo;t obey the doctor and take your medicine at the right time! You mustn&rsquo;t trifle with it, you know, or it may turn to pneumonia,&rdquo; she would go on, deriving much comfort from the utterance of that foreign word, incomprehensible to others as well as to herself.</p><p>What would Sónya have done without the glad consciousness that she had not undressed during the first three nights, in order to be ready to carry out all the doctor&rsquo;s injunctions with precision, and that she still kept awake at night so as not to miss the proper time when the slightly harmful pills in the little gilt box had to be administered?</p>",
  "page-220": "<p> Even to Natásha herself it was pleasant to see that so many sacrifices were being made for her sake, and to know that she had to take medicine at certain hours, though she declared that no medicine would cure her and that it was all nonsense. And it was even pleasant to be able to show, by disregarding the orders, that she did not believe in medical treatment and did not value her life.</p><p>The doctor came every day, felt her pulse, looked at her tongue, and regardless of her grief-stricken face joked with her. But when he had gone into another room, to which the countess hurriedly followed him, he assumed a grave air and thoughtfully shaking his head said that though there was danger, he had hopes of the effect of this last medicine and one must wait and see, that the malady was chiefly mental, but...</p>",
  "page-221": "<p> And the countess, trying to conceal the action from herself and from him, slipped a gold coin into his hand and always returned to the patient with a more tranquil mind.</p><p>The symptoms of Natásha&rsquo;s illness were that she ate little, slept little, coughed, and was always low-spirited. The doctors said that she could not get on without medical treatment, so they kept her in the stifling atmosphere of the town, and the Rostóvs did not move to the country that summer of 1812.</p><p>In spite of the many pills she swallowed and the drops and powders out of the little bottles and boxes of which Madame Schoss who was fond of such things made a large collection, and in spite of being deprived of the country life to which she was accustomed, youth prevailed.</p>",
  "page-222": "<p> Natásha&rsquo;s grief began to be overlaid by the impressions of daily life, it ceased to press so painfully on her heart, it gradually faded into the past, and she began to recover physically.</p>",
  "page-223": "<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>",
  "page-224": "<p>Natásha was calmer but no happier. She not merely avoided all external forms of pleasure&mdash;balls, promenades, concerts, and theaters&mdash;but she never laughed without a sound of tears in her laughter. She could not sing. As soon as she began to laugh, or tried to sing by herself, tears choked her: tears of remorse, tears at the recollection of those pure times which could never return, tears of vexation that she should so uselessly have ruined her young life which might have been so happy. Laughter and singing in particular seemed to her like a blasphemy, in face of her sorrow. Without any need of self-restraint, no wish to coquet ever entered her head. She said and felt at that time that no man was more to her than Nastásya Ivánovna, the buffoon. Something stood sentinel within her and forbade her every joy.</p>",
  "page-225": "<p> Besides, she had lost all the old interests of her carefree girlish life that had been so full of hope. The previous autumn, the hunting, &ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; and the Christmas holidays spent with Nicholas at Otrádnoe were what she recalled oftenest and most painfully. What would she not have given to bring back even a single day of that time! But it was gone forever. Her presentiment at the time had not deceived her&mdash;that that state of freedom and readiness for any enjoyment would not return again. Yet it was necessary to live on.</p><p>It comforted her to reflect that she was not better as she had formerly imagined, but worse, much worse, than anybody else in the world. But this was not enough. She knew that, and asked herself, &ldquo;What next?&rdquo; But there was nothing to come. There was no joy in life, yet life was passing.</p>",
  "page-226": "<p> Natásha apparently tried not to be a burden or a hindrance to anyone, but wanted nothing for herself. She kept away from everyone in the house and felt at ease only with her brother Pétya. She liked to be with him better than with the others, and when alone with him she sometimes laughed. She hardly ever left the house and of those who came to see them was glad to see only one person, Pierre. It would have been impossible to treat her with more delicacy, greater care, and at the same time more seriously than did Count Bezúkhov. Natásha unconsciously felt this delicacy and so found great pleasure in his society. But she was not even grateful to him for it; nothing good on Pierre&rsquo;s part seemed to her to be an effort, it seemed so natural for him to be kind to everyone that there was no merit in his kindness.</p>",
  "page-227": "<p> Sometimes Natásha noticed embarrassment and awkwardness on his part in her presence, especially when he wanted to do something to please her, or feared that something they spoke of would awaken memories distressing to her. She noticed this and attributed it to his general kindness and shyness, which she imagined must be the same toward everyone as it was to her. After those involuntary words&mdash;that if he were free he would have asked on his knees for her hand and her love&mdash;uttered at a moment when she was so strongly agitated, Pierre never spoke to Natásha of his feelings; and it seemed plain to her that those words, which had then so comforted her, were spoken as all sorts of meaningless words are spoken to comfort a crying child.</p>",
  "page-228": "<p> It was not because Pierre was a married man, but because Natásha felt very strongly with him that moral barrier the absence of which she had experienced with Kurágin that it never entered her head that the relations between him and herself could lead to love on her part, still less on his, or even to the kind of tender, self-conscious, romantic friendship between a man and a woman of which she had known several instances.</p><p>Before the end of the fast of St. Peter, Agraféna Ivánovna Belóva, a country neighbor of the Rostóvs, came to Moscow to pay her devotions at the shrines of the Moscow saints. She suggested that Natásha should fast and prepare for Holy Communion, and Natásha gladly welcomed the idea.</p>",
  "page-229": "<p> Despite the doctor&rsquo;s orders that she should not go out early in the morning, Natásha insisted on fasting and preparing for the sacrament, not as they generally prepared for it in the Rostóv family by attending three services in their own house, but as Agraféna Ivánovna did, by going to church every day for a week and not once missing Vespers, Matins, or Mass.</p><p>The countess was pleased with Natásha&rsquo;s zeal; after the poor results of the medical treatment, in the depths of her heart she hoped that prayer might help her daughter more than medicines and, though not without fear and concealing it from the doctor, she agreed to Natásha&rsquo;s wish and entrusted her to Belóva. Agraféna Ivánovna used to come to wake Natásha at three in the morning, but generally found her already awake. She was afraid of being late for Matins.</p>",
  "page-230": "<p> Hastily washing, and meekly putting on her shabbiest dress and an old mantilla, Natásha, shivering in the fresh air, went out into the deserted streets lit by the clear light of dawn. By Agraféna Ivánovna&rsquo;s advice Natásha prepared herself not in their own parish, but at a church where, according to the devout Agraféna Ivánovna, the priest was a man of very severe and lofty life. There were never many people in the church; Natásha always stood beside Belóva in the customary place before an icon of the Blessed Virgin, let into the screen before the choir on the left side, and a feeling, new to her, of humility before something great and incomprehensible, seized her when at that unusual morning hour, gazing at the dark face of the Virgin illuminated by the candles burning before it and by the morning light falling from the window, she listened to the words of the service which she tried to follow with understanding.</p>",
  "page-231": "<p> When she understood them her personal feeling became interwoven in the prayers with shades of its own. When she did not understand, it was sweeter still to think that the wish to understand everything is pride, that it is impossible to understand all, that it is only necessary to believe and to commit oneself to God, whom she felt guiding her soul at those moments. She crossed herself, bowed low, and when she did not understand, in horror at her own vileness, simply asked God to forgive her everything, everything, to have mercy upon her. The prayers to which she surrendered herself most of all were those of repentance. On her way home at an early hour when she met no one but bricklayers going to work or men sweeping the street, and everybody within the houses was still asleep, Natásha experienced a feeling new to her, a sense of the possibility of correcting her faults, the possibility of a new, clean life, and of happiness.</p>",
  "page-232": "<p>During the whole week she spent in this way, that feeling grew every day. And the happiness of taking communion, or &ldquo;communing&rdquo; as Agraféna Ivánovna, joyously playing with the word, called it, seemed to Natásha so great that she felt she should never live till that blessed Sunday.</p><p>But the happy day came, and on that memorable Sunday, when, dressed in white muslin, she returned home after communion, for the first time for many months she felt calm and not oppressed by the thought of the life that lay before her.</p><p>The doctor who came to see her that day ordered her to continue the powders he had prescribed a fortnight previously.</p>",
  "page-233": "<p>&ldquo;She must certainly go on taking them morning and evening,&rdquo; said he, evidently sincerely satisfied with his success. &ldquo;Only, please be particular about it.</p><p>&ldquo;Be quite easy,&rdquo; he continued playfully, as he adroitly took the gold coin in his palm. &ldquo;She will soon be singing and frolicking about. The last medicine has done her a very great deal of good. She has freshened up very much.&rdquo;</p><p>The countess, with a cheerful expression on her face, looked down at her nails and spat a little for luck as she returned to the drawing room.</p>",
  "page-234": "<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>",
  "page-235": "<p>At the beginning of July more and more disquieting reports about the war began to spread in Moscow; people spoke of an appeal by the Emperor to the people, and of his coming himself from the army to Moscow. And as up to the eleventh of July no manifesto or appeal had been received, exaggerated reports became current about them and about the position of Russia. It was said that the Emperor was leaving the army because it was in danger, it was said that Smolénsk had surrendered, that Napoleon had an army of a million and only a miracle could save Russia.</p><p>On the eleventh of July, which was Saturday, the manifesto was received but was not yet in print, and Pierre, who was at the Rostóvs&rsquo;, promised to come to dinner next day, Sunday, and bring a copy of the manifesto and appeal, which he would obtain from Count Rostopchín.</p>",
  "page-236": "<p>That Sunday, the Rostóvs went to Mass at the Razumóvskis&rsquo; private chapel as usual. It was a hot July day. Even at ten o&rsquo;clock, when the Rostóvs got out of their carriage at the chapel, the sultry air, the shouts of hawkers, the light and gay summer clothes of the crowd, the dusty leaves of the trees on the boulevard, the sounds of the band and the white trousers of a battalion marching to parade, the rattling of wheels on the cobblestones, and the brilliant, hot sunshine were all full of that summer languor, that content and discontent with the present, which is most strongly felt on a bright, hot day in town. All the Moscow notabilities, all the Rostóvs&rsquo; acquaintances, were at the Razumóvskis&rsquo; chapel, for, as if expecting something to happen, many wealthy families who usually left town for their country estates had not gone away that summer.</p>",
  "page-237": "<p> As Natásha, at her mother&rsquo;s side, passed through the crowd behind a liveried footman who cleared the way for them, she heard a young man speaking about her in too loud a whisper.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Rostóva, the one who...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s much thinner, but all the same she&rsquo;s pretty!&rdquo;</p><p>She heard, or thought she heard, the names of Kurágin and Bolkónski. But she was always imagining that. It always seemed to her that everyone who looked at her was thinking only of what had happened to her. With a sinking heart, wretched as she always was now when she found herself in a crowd, Natásha in her lilac silk dress trimmed with black lace walked&mdash;as women can walk&mdash;with the more repose and stateliness the greater the pain and shame in her soul.</p>",
  "page-238": "<p> She knew for certain that she was pretty, but this no longer gave her satisfaction as it used to. On the contrary it tormented her more than anything else of late, and particularly so on this bright, hot summer day in town. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Sunday again&mdash;another week past,&rdquo; she thought, recalling that she had been here the Sunday before, &ldquo;and always the same life that is no life, and the same surroundings in which it used to be so easy to live. I&rsquo;m pretty, I&rsquo;m young, and I know that now I am good. I used to be bad, but now I know I am good,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;but yet my best years are slipping by and are no good to anyone.&rdquo; She stood by her mother&rsquo;s side and exchanged nods with acquaintances near her.</p>",
  "page-239": "<p> From habit she scrutinized the ladies&rsquo; dresses, condemned the bearing of a lady standing close by who was not crossing herself properly but in a cramped manner, and again she thought with vexation that she was herself being judged and was judging others, and suddenly, at the sound of the service, she felt horrified at her own vileness, horrified that the former purity of her soul was again lost to her.</p><p>A comely, fresh-looking old man was conducting the service with that mild solemnity which has so elevating and soothing an effect on the souls of the worshipers. The gates of the sanctuary screen were closed, the curtain was slowly drawn, and from behind it a soft mysterious voice pronounced some words. Tears, the cause of which she herself did not understand, made Natásha&rsquo;s breast heave, and a joyous but oppressive feeling agitated her.</p>",
  "page-240": "<p>&ldquo;Teach me what I should do, how to live my life, how I may grow good forever, forever!&rdquo; she pleaded.</p><p>The deacon came out onto the raised space before the altar screen and, holding his thumb extended, drew his long hair from under his dalmatic and, making the sign of the cross on his breast, began in a loud and solemn voice to recite the words of the prayer....</p><p>&ldquo;In peace let us pray unto the Lord.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As one community, without distinction of class, without enmity, united by brotherly love&mdash;let us pray!&rdquo; thought Natásha.</p><p>&ldquo;For the peace that is from above, and for the salvation of our souls.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-241": "<p>&ldquo;For the world of angels and all the spirits who dwell above us,&rdquo; prayed Natásha.</p><p>When they prayed for the warriors, she thought of her brother and Denísov. When they prayed for all traveling by land and sea, she remembered Prince Andrew, prayed for him, and asked God to forgive her all the wrongs she had done him. When they prayed for those who love us, she prayed for the members of her own family, her father and mother and Sónya, realizing for the first time how wrongly she had acted toward them, and feeling all the strength of her love for them. When they prayed for those who hate us, she tried to think of her enemies and people who hated her, in order to pray for them.</p>",
  "page-242": "<p> She included among her enemies the creditors and all who had business dealings with her father, and always at the thought of enemies and those who hated her she remembered Anatole who had done her so much harm&mdash;and though he did not hate her she gladly prayed for him as for an enemy. Only at prayer did she feel able to think clearly and calmly of Prince Andrew and Anatole, as men for whom her feelings were as nothing compared with her awe and devotion to God. When they prayed for the Imperial family and the Synod, she bowed very low and made the sign of the cross, saying to herself that even if she did not understand, still she could not doubt, and at any rate loved the governing Synod and prayed for it.</p>",
  "page-243": "<p>When he had finished the Litany the deacon crossed the stole over his breast and said, &ldquo;Let us commit ourselves and our whole lives to Christ the Lord!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Commit ourselves to God,&rdquo; Natásha inwardly repeated. &ldquo;Lord God, I submit myself to Thy will!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I want nothing, wish for nothing; teach me what to do and how to use my will! Take me, take me!&rdquo; prayed Natásha, with impatient emotion in her heart, not crossing herself but letting her slender arms hang down as if expecting some invisible power at any moment to take her and deliver her from herself, from her regrets, desires, remorse, hopes, and sins.</p>",
  "page-244": "<p>The countess looked round several times at her daughter&rsquo;s softened face and shining eyes and prayed God to help her.</p><p>Unexpectedly, in the middle of the service, and not in the usual order Natásha knew so well, the deacon brought out a small stool, the one he knelt on when praying on Trinity Sunday, and placed it before the doors of the sanctuary screen. The priest came out with his purple velvet biretta on his head, adjusted his hair, and knelt down with an effort. Everybody followed his example and they looked at one another in surprise. Then came the prayer just received from the Synod&mdash;a prayer for the deliverance of Russia from hostile invasion.</p>",
  "page-245": "<p>&ldquo;Lord God of might, God of our salvation!&rdquo; began the priest in that voice, clear, not grandiloquent but mild, in which only the Slav clergy read and which acts so irresistibly on a Russian heart.</p><p>&ldquo;Lord God of might, God of our salvation! Look this day in mercy and blessing on Thy humble people, and graciously hear us, spare us, and have mercy upon us! This foe confounding Thy land, desiring to lay waste the whole world, rises against us; these lawless men are gathered together to overthrow Thy kingdom, to destroy Thy dear Jerusalem, Thy beloved Russia; to defile Thy temples, to overthrow Thine altars, and to desecrate our holy shrines. How long, O Lord, how long shall the wicked triumph? How long shall they wield unlawful power?</p>",
  "page-246": "<p>&ldquo;Lord God! Hear us when we pray to Thee; strengthen with Thy might our most gracious sovereign lord, the Emperor Alexander Pávlovich; be mindful of his uprightness and meekness, reward him according to his righteousness, and let it preserve us, Thy chosen Israel! Bless his counsels, his undertakings, and his work; strengthen his kingdom by Thine almighty hand, and give him victory over his enemy, even as Thou gavest Moses the victory over Amalek, Gideon over Midian, and David over Goliath. Preserve his army, put a bow of brass in the hands of those who have armed themselves in Thy Name, and gird their loins with strength for the fight. Take up the spear and shield and arise to help us; confound and put to shame those who have devised evil against us, may they be before the faces of Thy faithful warriors as dust before the wind, and may Thy mighty Angel confound them and put them to flight;</p>",
  "page-247": "<p> may they be ensnared when they know it not, and may the plots they have laid in secret be turned against them; let them fall before Thy servants&rsquo; feet and be laid low by our hosts! Lord, Thou art able to save both great and small; Thou art God, and man cannot prevail against Thee!</p><p>&ldquo;God of our fathers! Remember Thy bounteous mercy and loving-kindness which are from of old; turn not Thy face from us, but be gracious to our unworthiness, and in Thy great goodness and Thy many mercies regard not our transgressions and iniquities! Create in us a clean heart and renew a right spirit within us, strengthen us all in Thy faith, fortify our hope, inspire us with true love one for another, arm us with unity of spirit in the righteous defense of the heritage Thou gavest to us and to our fathers, and let not the scepter of the wicked be exalted against the destiny of those Thou hast sanctified.</p>",
  "page-248": "<p>&ldquo;O Lord our God, in whom we believe and in whom we put our trust, let us not be confounded in our hope of Thy mercy, and give us a token of Thy blessing, that those who hate us and our Orthodox faith may see it and be put to shame and perish, and may all the nations know that Thou art the Lord and we are Thy people. Show Thy mercy upon us this day, O Lord, and grant us Thy salvation; make the hearts of Thy servants to rejoice in Thy mercy; smite down our enemies and destroy them swiftly beneath the feet of Thy faithful servants! For Thou art the defense, the succor, and the victory of them that put their trust in Thee, and to Thee be all glory, to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, now and forever, world without end. Amen.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-249": "<p>In Natásha&rsquo;s receptive condition of soul this prayer affected her strongly. She listened to every word about the victory of Moses over Amalek, of Gideon over Midian, and of David over Goliath, and about the destruction of &ldquo;Thy Jerusalem,&rdquo; and she prayed to God with the tenderness and emotion with which her heart was overflowing, but without fully understanding what she was asking of God in that prayer. She shared with all her heart in the prayer for the spirit of righteousness, for the strengthening of the heart by faith and hope, and its animation by love. But she could not pray that her enemies might be trampled under foot when but a few minutes before she had been wishing she had more of them that she might pray for them. But neither could she doubt the righteousness of the prayer that was being read on bended knees.</p>",
  "page-250": "<p> She felt in her heart a devout and tremulous awe at the thought of the punishment that overtakes men for their sins, and especially of her own sins, and she prayed to God to forgive them all, and her too, and to give them all, and her too, peace and happiness. And it seemed to her that God heard her prayer.</p>",
  "page-251": "<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>",
  "page-252": "<p>From the day when Pierre, after leaving the Rostóvs&rsquo; with Natásha&rsquo;s grateful look fresh in his mind, had gazed at the comet that seemed to be fixed in the sky and felt that something new was appearing on his own horizon&mdash;from that day the problem of the vanity and uselessness of all earthly things, that had incessantly tormented him, no longer presented itself. That terrible question &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; &ldquo;Wherefore?&rdquo; which had come to him amid every occupation, was now replaced, not by another question or by a reply to the former question, but by her image. When he listened to, or himself took part in, trivial conversations, when he read or heard of human baseness or folly, he was not horrified as formerly, and did not ask himself why men struggled so about these things when all is so transient and incomprehensible&mdash;</p>",
  "page-253": "<p>but he remembered her as he had last seen her, and all his doubts vanished&mdash;not because she had answered the questions that had haunted him, but because his conception of her transferred him instantly to another, a brighter, realm of spiritual activity in which no one could be justified or guilty&mdash;a realm of beauty and love which it was worth living for. Whatever worldly baseness presented itself to him, he said to himself:</p><p>&ldquo;Well, supposing N. N. has swindled the country and the Tsar, and the country and the Tsar confer honors upon him, what does that matter? She smiled at me yesterday and asked me to come again, and I love her, and no one will ever know it.&rdquo; And his soul felt calm and peaceful.</p>",
  "page-254": "<p>Pierre still went into society, drank as much and led the same idle and dissipated life, because besides the hours he spent at the Rostóvs&rsquo; there were other hours he had to spend somehow, and the habits and acquaintances he had made in Moscow formed a current that bore him along irresistibly. But latterly, when more and more disquieting reports came from the seat of war and Natásha&rsquo;s health began to improve and she no longer aroused in him the former feeling of careful pity, an ever-increasing restlessness, which he could not explain, took possession of him. He felt that the condition he was in could not continue long, that a catastrophe was coming which would change his whole life, and he impatiently sought everywhere for signs of that approaching catastrophe. One of his brother Masons had revealed to Pierre the following prophecy concerning Napoleon, drawn from the Revelation of St. John.</p>",
  "page-255": "<p>In chapter 13, verse 18, of the Apocalypse, it is said:</p><p>Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.</p><p>And in the fifth verse of the same chapter:</p><p>And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.</p><p>The French alphabet, written out with the same numerical values as the Hebrew, in which the first nine letters denote units and the others tens, will have the following significance:</p>",
  "page-256": "<p>Writing the words L&rsquo;Empereur Napoléon in numbers, it appears that the sum of them is 666, and that Napoleon was therefore the beast foretold in the Apocalypse. Moreover, by applying the same system to the words quarante-deux, * which was the term allowed to the beast that &ldquo;spoke great things and blasphemies,&rdquo; the same number 666 was obtained; from which it followed that the limit fixed for Napoleon&rsquo;s power had come in the year 1812 when the French emperor was forty-two. This prophecy pleased Pierre very much and he often asked himself what would put an end to the power of the beast, that is, of Napoleon, and tried by the same system of using letters as numbers and adding them up, to find an answer to the question that engrossed him. He wrote the words L&rsquo;Empereur Alexandre, La nation russe and added up their numbers, but the sums were either more or less than 666.</p>",
  "page-257": "<p> Once when making such calculations he wrote down his own name in French, Comte Pierre Besouhoff, but the sum of the numbers did not come right. Then he changed the spelling, substituting a z for the s and adding de and the article le, still without obtaining the desired result. Then it occurred to him: if the answer to the question were contained in his name, his nationality would also be given in the answer. So he wrote Le russe Besuhof and adding up the numbers got 671. This was only five too much, and five was represented by e, the very letter elided from the article le before the word Empereur. By omitting the e, though incorrectly, Pierre got the answer he sought. L&rsquo;russe Besuhof made 666. This discovery excited him. How, or by what means, he was connected with the great event foretold in the Apocalypse he did not know, but he did not doubt that connection for a moment.</p>",
  "page-258": "<p> His love for Natásha, Antichrist, Napoleon, the invasion, the comet, 666, L&rsquo;Empereur Napoléon, and L&rsquo;russe Besuhof&mdash;all this had to mature and culminate, to lift him out of that spellbound, petty sphere of Moscow habits in which he felt himself held captive and lead him to a great achievement and great happiness.</p><p>On the eve of the Sunday when the special prayer was read, Pierre had promised the Rostóvs to bring them, from Count Rostopchín whom he knew well, both the appeal to the people and the news from the army. In the morning, when he went to call at Rostopchín&rsquo;s he met there a courier fresh from the army, an acquaintance of his own, who often danced at Moscow balls.</p>",
  "page-259": "<p>&ldquo;Do, please, for heaven&rsquo;s sake, relieve me of something!&rdquo; said the courier. &ldquo;I have a sackful of letters to parents.&rdquo;</p><p>Among these letters was one from Nicholas Rostóv to his father. Pierre took that letter, and Rostopchín also gave him the Emperor&rsquo;s appeal to Moscow, which had just been printed, the last army orders, and his own most recent bulletin. Glancing through the army orders, Pierre found in one of them, in the lists of killed, wounded, and rewarded, the name of Nicholas Rostóv, awarded a St. George&rsquo;s Cross of the Fourth Class for courage shown in the Ostróvna affair, and in the same order the name of Prince Andrew Bolkónski, appointed to the command of a regiment of Chasseurs.</p>",
  "page-260": "<p> Though he did not want to remind the Rostóvs of Bolkónski, Pierre could not refrain from making them happy by the news of their son&rsquo;s having received a decoration, so he sent that printed army order and Nicholas&rsquo; letter to the Rostóvs, keeping the appeal, the bulletin, and the other orders to take with him when he went to dinner.</p><p>His conversation with Count Rostopchín and the latter&rsquo;s tone of anxious hurry, the meeting with the courier who talked casually of how badly things were going in the army, the rumors of the discovery of spies in Moscow and of a leaflet in circulation stating that Napoleon promised to be in both the Russian capitals by the autumn, and the talk of the Emperor&rsquo;s being expected to arrive next day&mdash;</p>",
  "page-261": "<p>all aroused with fresh force that feeling of agitation and expectation in Pierre which he had been conscious of ever since the appearance of the comet, and especially since the beginning of the war.</p><p>He had long been thinking of entering the army and would have done so had he not been hindered, first, by his membership of the Society of Freemasons to which he was bound by oath and which preached perpetual peace and the abolition of war, and secondly, by the fact that when he saw the great mass of Muscovites who had donned uniform and were talking patriotism, he somehow felt ashamed to take the step. But the chief reason for not carrying out his intention to enter the army lay in the vague idea that he was L&rsquo;russe Besuhof who had the number of the beast, 666;</p>",
  "page-262": "<p> that his part in the great affair of setting a limit to the power of the beast that spoke great and blasphemous things had been predestined from eternity, and that therefore he ought not to undertake anything, but wait for what was bound to come to pass.</p>",
  "page-263": "<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>",
  "page-264": "<p>A few intimate friends were dining with the Rostóvs that day, as usual on Sundays.</p><p>Pierre came early so as to find them alone.</p><p>He had grown so stout this year that he would have been abnormal had he not been so tall, so broad of limb, and so strong that he carried his bulk with evident ease.</p><p>He went up the stairs, puffing and muttering something. His coachman did not even ask whether he was to wait. He knew that when his master was at the Rostóvs&rsquo; he stayed till midnight. The Rostóvs&rsquo; footman rushed eagerly forward to help him off with his cloak and take his hat and stick. Pierre, from club habit, always left both hat and stick in the anteroom.</p>",
  "page-265": "<p>The first person he saw in the house was Natásha. Even before he saw her, while taking off his cloak, he heard her. She was practicing solfa exercises in the music room. He knew that she had not sung since her illness, and so the sound of her voice surprised and delighted him. He opened the door softly and saw her, in the lilac dress she had worn at church, walking about the room singing. She had her back to him when he opened the door, but when, turning quickly, she saw his broad, surprised face, she blushed and came rapidly up to him.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to try to sing again,&rdquo; she said, adding as if by way of excuse, &ldquo;it is, at least, something to do.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-266": "<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s capital!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How glad I am you&rsquo;ve come! I am so happy today,&rdquo; she said, with the old animation Pierre had not seen in her for a long time. &ldquo;You know Nicholas has received a St. George&rsquo;s Cross? I am so proud of him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I sent that announcement. But I don&rsquo;t want to interrupt you,&rdquo; he added, and was about to go to the drawing room.</p><p>Natásha stopped him.</p><p>&ldquo;Count, is it wrong of me to sing?&rdquo; she said blushing, and fixing her eyes inquiringly on him.</p>",
  "page-267": "<p>&ldquo;No... Why should it be? On the contrary... But why do you ask me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know myself,&rdquo; Natásha answered quickly, &ldquo;but I should not like to do anything you disapproved of. I believe in you completely. You don&rsquo;t know how important you are to me, how much you&rsquo;ve done for me....&rdquo; She spoke rapidly and did not notice how Pierre flushed at her words. &ldquo;I saw in that same army order that he, Bolkónski&rdquo; (she whispered the name hastily), &ldquo;is in Russia, and in the army again. What do you think?&rdquo;&mdash;she was speaking hurriedly, evidently afraid her strength might fail her&mdash;&ldquo;Will he ever forgive me? Will he not always have a bitter feeling toward me? What do you think? What do you think?&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-268": "<p>&ldquo;I think...&rdquo; Pierre replied, &ldquo;that he has nothing to forgive.... If I were in his place...&rdquo;</p><p>By association of ideas, Pierre was at once carried back to the day when, trying to comfort her, he had said that if he were not himself but the best man in the world and free, he would ask on his knees for her hand; and the same feeling of pity, tenderness, and love took possession of him and the same words rose to his lips. But she did not give him time to say them.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, you... you...&rdquo; she said, uttering the word you rapturously&mdash;&ldquo;that&rsquo;s a different thing. I know no one kinder, more generous, or better than you; nobody could be! Had you not been there then, and now too, I don&rsquo;t know what would have become of me, because...&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-269": "<p>Tears suddenly rose in her eyes, she turned away, lifted her music before her eyes, began singing again, and again began walking up and down the room.</p><p>Just then Pétya came running in from the drawing room.</p><p>Pétya was now a handsome rosy lad of fifteen with full red lips and resembled Natásha. He was preparing to enter the university, but he and his friend Obolénski had lately, in secret, agreed to join the hussars.</p><p>Pétya had come rushing out to talk to his namesake about this affair. He had asked Pierre to find out whether he would be accepted in the hussars.</p>",
  "page-270": "<p>Pierre walked up and down the drawing room, not listening to what Pétya was saying.</p><p>Pétya pulled him by the arm to attract his attention.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, what about my plan? Peter Kirílych, for heaven&rsquo;s sake! You are my only hope,&rdquo; said Pétya.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yes, your plan. To join the hussars? I&rsquo;ll mention it, I&rsquo;ll bring it all up today.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, mon cher, have you got the manifesto?&rdquo; asked the old count. &ldquo;The countess has been to Mass at the Razumóvskis&rsquo; and heard the new prayer. She says it&rsquo;s very fine.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-271": "<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve got it,&rdquo; said Pierre. &ldquo;The Emperor is to be here tomorrow... there&rsquo;s to be an Extraordinary Meeting of the nobility, and they are talking of a levy of ten men per thousand. Oh yes, let me congratulate you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, thank God! Well, and what news from the army?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We are again retreating. They say we&rsquo;re already near Smolénsk,&rdquo; replied Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;O Lord, O Lord!&rdquo; exclaimed the count. &ldquo;Where is the manifesto?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Emperor&rsquo;s appeal? Oh yes!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-272": "<p>Pierre began feeling in his pockets for the papers, but could not find them. Still slapping his pockets, he kissed the hand of the countess who entered the room and glanced uneasily around, evidently expecting Natásha, who had left off singing but had not yet come into the drawing room.</p><p>&ldquo;On my word, I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve done with it,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;There he is, always losing everything!&rdquo; remarked the countess.</p><p>Natásha entered with a softened and agitated expression of face and sat down looking silently at Pierre. As soon as she entered, Pierre&rsquo;s features, which had been gloomy, suddenly lighted up, and while still searching for the papers he glanced at her several times.</p>",
  "page-273": "<p>&ldquo;No, really! I&rsquo;ll drive home, I must have left them there. I&rsquo;ll certainly...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll be late for dinner.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! And my coachman has gone.&rdquo;</p><p>But Sónya, who had gone to look for the papers in the anteroom, had found them in Pierre&rsquo;s hat, where he had carefully tucked them under the lining. Pierre was about to begin reading.</p><p>&ldquo;No, after dinner,&rdquo; said the old count, evidently expecting much enjoyment from that reading.</p><p>At dinner, at which champagne was drunk to the health of the new chevalier of St. George, Shinshín told them the town news, of the illness of the old Georgian princess, of Métivier&rsquo;s disappearance from Moscow, and of how some German fellow had been brought to Rostopchín and accused of being a French &ldquo;spyer&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-274": "<p> (so Count Rostopchín had told the story), and how Rostopchín let him go and assured the people that he was &ldquo;not a spire at all, but only an old German ruin.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;People are being arrested...&rdquo; said the count. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told the countess she should not speak French so much. It&rsquo;s not the time for it now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And have you heard?&rdquo; Shinshín asked. &ldquo;Prince Golítsyn has engaged a master to teach him Russian. It is becoming dangerous to speak French in the streets.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And how about you, Count Peter Kirílych? If they call up the militia, you too will have to mount a horse,&rdquo; remarked the old count, addressing Pierre.</p>",
  "page-275": "<p>Pierre had been silent and preoccupied all through dinner, seeming not to grasp what was said. He looked at the count.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yes, the war,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No! What sort of warrior should I make? And yet everything is so strange, so strange! I can&rsquo;t make it out. I don&rsquo;t know, I am very far from having military tastes, but in these times no one can answer for himself.&rdquo;</p><p>After dinner the count settled himself comfortably in an easy chair and with a serious face asked Sónya, who was considered an excellent reader, to read the appeal.</p><p>&ldquo;To Moscow, our ancient Capital!</p>",
  "page-276": "<p>&ldquo;The enemy has entered the borders of Russia with immense forces. He comes to despoil our beloved country.&rdquo;</p><p>Sónya read painstakingly in her high-pitched voice. The count listened with closed eyes, heaving abrupt sighs at certain passages.</p><p>Natásha sat erect, gazing with a searching look now at her father and now at Pierre.</p><p>Pierre felt her eyes on him and tried not to look round. The countess shook her head disapprovingly and angrily at every solemn expression in the manifesto. In all these words she saw only that the danger threatening her son would not soon be over. Shinshín, with a sarcastic smile on his lips, was evidently preparing to make fun of anything that gave him the opportunity: Sónya&rsquo;s reading, any remark of the count&rsquo;s, or even the manifesto itself should no better pretext present itself.</p>",
  "page-277": "<p>After reading about the dangers that threatened Russia, the hopes the Emperor placed on Moscow and especially on its illustrious nobility, Sónya, with a quiver in her voice due chiefly to the attention that was being paid to her, read the last words:</p><p>&ldquo;We ourselves will not delay to appear among our people in that Capital and in other parts of our realm for consultation, and for the direction of all our levies, both those now barring the enemy&rsquo;s path and those freshly formed to defeat him wherever he may appear. May the ruin he hopes to bring upon us recoil on his own head, and may Europe delivered from bondage glorify the name of Russia!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-278": "<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; cried the count, opening his moist eyes and sniffing repeatedly, as if a strong vinaigrette had been held to his nose; and he added, &ldquo;Let the Emperor but say the word and we&rsquo;ll sacrifice everything and begrudge nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>Before Shinshín had time to utter the joke he was ready to make on the count&rsquo;s patriotism, Natásha jumped up from her place and ran to her father.</p><p>&ldquo;What a darling our Papa is!&rdquo; she cried, kissing him, and she again looked at Pierre with the unconscious coquetry that had returned to her with her better spirits.</p>",
  "page-279": "<p>&ldquo;There! Here&rsquo;s a patriot for you!&rdquo; said Shinshín.</p><p>&ldquo;Not a patriot at all, but simply...&rdquo; Natásha replied in an injured tone. &ldquo;Everything seems funny to you, but this isn&rsquo;t at all a joke....&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A joke indeed!&rdquo; put in the count. &ldquo;Let him but say the word and we&rsquo;ll all go.... We&rsquo;re not Germans!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But did you notice, it says, &lsquo;for consultation&rsquo;?&rdquo; said Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;Never mind what it&rsquo;s for....&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-280": "<p>At this moment, Pétya, to whom nobody was paying any attention, came up to his father with a very flushed face and said in his breaking voice that was now deep and now shrill:</p><p>&ldquo;Well, Papa, I tell you definitely, and Mamma too, it&rsquo;s as you please, but I say definitely that you must let me enter the army, because I can&rsquo;t... that&rsquo;s all....&rdquo;</p><p>The countess, in dismay, looked up to heaven, clasped her hands, and turned angrily to her husband.</p><p>&ldquo;That comes of your talking!&rdquo; said she.</p><p>But the count had already recovered from his excitement.</p>",
  "page-281": "<p>&ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a fine warrior! No! Nonsense! You must study.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not nonsense, Papa. Fédya Obolénski is younger than I, and he&rsquo;s going too. Besides, all the same I can&rsquo;t study now when...&rdquo; Pétya stopped short, flushed till he perspired, but still got out the words, &ldquo;when our Fatherland is in danger.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do, that&rsquo;ll do&mdash;nonsense....&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you said yourself that we would sacrifice everything.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-282": "<p>&ldquo;Pétya! Be quiet, I tell you!&rdquo; cried the count, with a glance at his wife, who had turned pale and was staring fixedly at her son.</p><p>&ldquo;And I tell you&mdash;Peter Kirílych here will also tell you...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nonsense, I tell you. Your mother&rsquo;s milk has hardly dried on your lips and you want to go into the army! There, there, I tell you,&rdquo; and the count moved to go out of the room, taking the papers, probably to reread them in his study before having a nap.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, Peter Kirílych, let&rsquo;s go and have a smoke,&rdquo; he said.</p>",
  "page-283": "<p>Pierre was agitated and undecided. Natásha&rsquo;s unwontedly brilliant eyes, continually glancing at him with a more than cordial look, had reduced him to this condition.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I think I&rsquo;ll go home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Home? Why, you meant to spend the evening with us.... You don&rsquo;t often come nowadays as it is, and this girl of mine,&rdquo; said the count good-naturedly, pointing to Natásha, &ldquo;only brightens up when you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I had forgotten... I really must go home... business...&rdquo; said Pierre hurriedly.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, then, au revoir!&rdquo; said the count, and went out of the room.</p>",
  "page-284": "<p>&ldquo;Why are you going? Why are you upset?&rdquo; asked Natásha, and she looked challengingly into Pierre&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Because I love you!&rdquo; was what he wanted to say, but he did not say it, and only blushed till the tears came, and lowered his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Because it is better for me to come less often... because... No, simply I have business....&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why? No, tell me!&rdquo; Natásha began resolutely and suddenly stopped.</p><p>They looked at each other with dismayed and embarrassed faces. He tried to smile but could not: his smile expressed suffering, and he silently kissed her hand and went out.</p>",
  "page-285": "<p>Pierre made up his mind not to go to the Rostóvs&rsquo; any more.</p>",
  "page-286": "<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>",
  "page-287": "<p>After the definite refusal he had received, Pétya went to his room and there locked himself in and wept bitterly. When he came in to tea, silent, morose, and with tear-stained face, everybody pretended not to notice anything.</p><p>Next day the Emperor arrived in Moscow, and several of the Rostóvs&rsquo; domestic serfs begged permission to go to have a look at him. That morning Pétya was a long time dressing and arranging his hair and collar to look like a grown-up man. He frowned before his looking glass, gesticulated, shrugged his shoulders, and finally, without saying a word to anyone, took his cap and left the house by the back door, trying to avoid notice. Pétya decided to go straight to where the Emperor was and to explain frankly to some gentleman-in-waiting (he imagined the Emperor to be always surrounded by gentlemen-in-waiting) that he, Count Rostóv, in spite of his youth wished to serve his country;</p>",
  "page-288": "<p> that youth could be no hindrance to loyalty, and that he was ready to... While dressing, Pétya had prepared many fine things he meant to say to the gentleman-in-waiting.</p><p>It was on the very fact of being so young that Pétya counted for success in reaching the Emperor&mdash;he even thought how surprised everyone would be at his youthfulness&mdash;and yet in the arrangement of his collar and hair and by his sedate deliberate walk he wished to appear a grown-up man. But the farther he went and the more his attention was diverted by the ever-increasing crowds moving toward the Krémlin, the less he remembered to walk with the sedateness and deliberation of a man. As he approached the Krémlin he even began to avoid being crushed and resolutely stuck out his elbows in a menacing way.</p>",
  "page-289": "<p> But within the Trinity Gateway he was so pressed to the wall by people who probably were unaware of the patriotic intentions with which he had come that in spite of all his determination he had to give in, and stop while carriages passed in, rumbling beneath the archway. Beside Pétya stood a peasant woman, a footman, two tradesmen, and a discharged soldier. After standing some time in the gateway, Pétya tried to move forward in front of the others without waiting for all the carriages to pass, and he began resolutely working his way with his elbows, but the woman just in front of him, who was the first against whom he directed his efforts, angrily shouted at him:</p><p>&ldquo;What are you shoving for, young lordling? Don&rsquo;t you see we&rsquo;re all standing still? Then why push?&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-290": "<p>&ldquo;Anybody can shove,&rdquo; said the footman, and also began working his elbows to such effect that he pushed Pétya into a very filthy corner of the gateway.</p><p>Pétya wiped his perspiring face with his hands and pulled up the damp collar which he had arranged so well at home to seem like a man&rsquo;s.</p><p>He felt that he no longer looked presentable, and feared that if he were now to approach the gentlemen-in-waiting in that plight he would not be admitted to the Emperor. But it was impossible to smarten oneself up or move to another place, because of the crowd. One of the generals who drove past was an acquaintance of the Rostóvs&rsquo;, and Pétya thought of asking his help, but came to the conclusion that that would not be a manly thing to do.</p>",
  "page-291": "<p> When the carriages had all passed in, the crowd, carrying Pétya with it, streamed forward into the Krémlin Square which was already full of people. There were people not only in the square, but everywhere&mdash;on the slopes and on the roofs. As soon as Pétya found himself in the square he clearly heard the sound of bells and the joyous voices of the crowd that filled the whole Krémlin.</p><p>For a while the crowd was less dense, but suddenly all heads were bared, and everyone rushed forward in one direction. Pétya was being pressed so that he could scarcely breathe, and everybody shouted, &ldquo;Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!&rdquo; Pétya stood on tiptoe and pushed and pinched, but could see nothing except the people about him.</p>",
  "page-292": "<p>All the faces bore the same expression of excitement and enthusiasm. A tradesman&rsquo;s wife standing beside Pétya sobbed, and the tears ran down her cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;Father! Angel! Dear one!&rdquo; she kept repeating, wiping away her tears with her fingers.</p><p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; was heard on all sides.</p><p>For a moment the crowd stood still, but then it made another rush forward.</p><p>Quite beside himself, Pétya, clinching his teeth and rolling his eyes ferociously, pushed forward, elbowing his way and shouting &ldquo;hurrah!&rdquo; as if he were prepared that instant to kill himself and everyone else, but on both sides of him other people with similarly ferocious faces pushed forward and everybody shouted &ldquo;hurrah!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-293": "<p>&ldquo;So this is what the Emperor is!&rdquo; thought Pétya. &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t petition him myself&mdash;that would be too bold.&rdquo; But in spite of this he continued to struggle desperately forward, and from between the backs of those in front he caught glimpses of an open space with a strip of red cloth spread out on it; but just then the crowd swayed back&mdash;the police in front were pushing back those who had pressed too close to the procession: the Emperor was passing from the palace to the Cathedral of the Assumption&mdash;and Pétya unexpectedly received such a blow on his side and ribs and was squeezed so hard that suddenly everything grew dim before his eyes and he lost consciousness. When he came to himself, a man of clerical appearance with a tuft of gray hair at the back of his head and wearing a shabby blue cassock&mdash;probably a church clerk and chanter&mdash;</p>",
  "page-294": "<p>was holding him under the arm with one hand while warding off the pressure of the crowd with the other.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve crushed the young gentleman!&rdquo; said the clerk. &ldquo;What are you up to? Gently!... They&rsquo;ve crushed him, crushed him!&rdquo;</p><p>The Emperor entered the Cathedral of the Assumption. The crowd spread out again more evenly, and the clerk led Pétya&mdash;pale and breathless&mdash;to the Tsar-cannon. Several people were sorry for Pétya, and suddenly a crowd turned toward him and pressed round him. Those who stood nearest him attended to him, unbuttoned his coat, seated him on the raised platform of the cannon, and reproached those others (whoever they might be) who had crushed him.</p>",
  "page-295": "<p>&ldquo;One might easily get killed that way! What do they mean by it? Killing people! Poor dear, he&rsquo;s as white as a sheet!&rdquo;&mdash;various voices were heard saying.</p><p>Pétya soon came to himself, the color returned to his face, the pain had passed, and at the cost of that temporary unpleasantness he had obtained a place by the cannon from where he hoped to see the Emperor who would be returning that way. Pétya no longer thought of presenting his petition. If he could only see the Emperor he would be happy!</p><p>While the service was proceeding in the Cathedral of the Assumption&mdash;it was a combined service of prayer on the occasion of the Emperor&rsquo;s arrival and of thanksgiving for the conclusion of peace with the Turks&mdash;</p>",
  "page-296": "<p>the crowd outside spread out and hawkers appeared, selling kvas, gingerbread, and poppyseed sweets (of which Pétya was particularly fond), and ordinary conversation could again be heard. A tradesman&rsquo;s wife was showing a rent in her shawl and telling how much the shawl had cost; another was saying that all silk goods had now got dear. The clerk who had rescued Pétya was talking to a functionary about the priests who were officiating that day with the bishop. The clerk several times used the word &ldquo;plenary&rdquo; (of the service), a word Pétya did not understand. Two young citizens were joking with some serf girls who were cracking nuts. All these conversations, especially the joking with the girls, were such as might have had a particular charm for Pétya at his age, but they did not interest him now.</p>",
  "page-297": "<p> He sat on his elevation&mdash;the pedestal of the cannon&mdash;still agitated as before by the thought of the Emperor and by his love for him. The feeling of pain and fear he had experienced when he was being crushed, together with that of rapture, still further intensified his sense of the importance of the occasion.</p><p>Suddenly the sound of a firing of cannon was heard from the embankment, to celebrate the signing of peace with the Turks, and the crowd rushed impetuously toward the embankment to watch the firing. Pétya too would have run there, but the clerk who had taken the young gentleman under his protection stopped him. The firing was still proceeding when officers, generals, and gentlemen-in-waiting came running out of the cathedral, and after them others in a more leisurely manner: caps were again raised, and those who had run to look at the cannon ran back again.</p>",
  "page-298": "<p> At last four men in uniforms and sashes emerged from the cathedral doors. &ldquo;Hurrah! hurrah!&rdquo; shouted the crowd again.</p><p>&ldquo;Which is he? Which?&rdquo; asked Pétya in a tearful voice, of those around him, but no one answered him, everybody was too excited; and Pétya, fixing on one of those four men, whom he could not clearly see for the tears of joy that filled his eyes, concentrated all his enthusiasm on him&mdash;though it happened not to be the Emperor&mdash;frantically shouted &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; and resolved that tomorrow, come what might, he would join the army.</p><p>The crowd ran after the Emperor, followed him to the palace, and began to disperse. It was already late, and Pétya had not eaten anything and was drenched with perspiration, yet he did not go home but stood with that diminishing, but still considerable, crowd before the palace while the Emperor dined&mdash;</p>",
  "page-299": "<p>looking in at the palace windows, expecting he knew not what, and envying alike the notables he saw arriving at the entrance to dine with the Emperor and the court footmen who served at table, glimpses of whom could be seen through the windows.</p><p>While the Emperor was dining, Valúev, looking out of the window, said:</p><p>&ldquo;The people are still hoping to see Your Majesty again.&rdquo;</p><p>The dinner was nearly over, and the Emperor, munching a biscuit, rose and went out onto the balcony. The people, with Pétya among them, rushed toward the balcony.</p><p>&ldquo;Angel! Dear one! Hurrah! Father!...&rdquo; cried the crowd, and Pétya with it, and again the women and men of weaker mold, Pétya among them, wept with joy.</p>",
  "page-300": "<p>A largish piece of the biscuit the Emperor was holding in his hand broke off, fell on the balcony parapet, and then to the ground. A coachman in a jerkin, who stood nearest, sprang forward and snatched it up. Several people in the crowd rushed at the coachman. Seeing this the Emperor had a plateful of biscuits brought him and began throwing them down from the balcony. Pétya&rsquo;s eyes grew bloodshot, and still more excited by the danger of being crushed, he rushed at the biscuits. He did not know why, but he had to have a biscuit from the Tsar&rsquo;s hand and he felt that he must not give way. He sprang forward and upset an old woman who was catching at a biscuit; the old woman did not consider herself defeated though she was lying on the ground&mdash;she grabbed at some biscuits but her hand did not reach them.</p>",
  "page-301": "<p> Pétya pushed her hand away with his knee, seized a biscuit, and as if fearing to be too late, again shouted &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; with a voice already hoarse.</p><p>The Emperor went in, and after that the greater part of the crowd began to disperse.</p><p>&ldquo;There! I said if only we waited&mdash;and so it was!&rdquo; was being joyfully said by various people.</p><p>Happy as Pétya was, he felt sad at having to go home knowing that all the enjoyment of that day was over. He did not go straight home from the Krémlin, but called on his friend Obolénski, who was fifteen and was also entering the regiment. On returning home Pétya announced resolutely and firmly that if he was not allowed to enter the service he would run away.</p>",
  "page-302": "<p> And next day, Count Ilyá Rostóv&mdash;though he had not yet quite yielded&mdash;went to inquire how he could arrange for Pétya to serve where there would be least danger.</p>",
  "page-303": "<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>",
  "page-304": "<p>Two days later, on the fifteenth of July, an immense number of carriages were standing outside the Slobóda Palace.</p><p>The great halls were full. In the first were the nobility and gentry in their uniforms, in the second bearded merchants in full-skirted coats of blue cloth and wearing medals. In the noblemen&rsquo;s hall there was an incessant movement and buzz of voices. The chief magnates sat on high-backed chairs at a large table under the portrait of the Emperor, but most of the gentry were strolling about the room.</p><p>All these nobles, whom Pierre met every day at the Club or in their own houses, were in uniform&mdash;some in that of Catherine&rsquo;s day, others in that of Emperor Paul, others again in the new uniforms of Alexander&rsquo;</p>",
  "page-305": "<p>s time or the ordinary uniform of the nobility, and the general characteristic of being in uniform imparted something strange and fantastic to these diverse and familiar personalities, both old and young. The old men, dim-eyed, toothless, bald, sallow, and bloated, or gaunt and wrinkled, were especially striking. For the most part they sat quietly in their places and were silent, or, if they walked about and talked, attached themselves to someone younger. On all these faces, as on the faces of the crowd Pétya had seen in the Square, there was a striking contradiction: the general expectation of a solemn event, and at the same time the everyday interests in a boston card party, Peter the cook, Zinaída Dmítrievna&rsquo;s health, and so on.</p><p>Pierre was there too, buttoned up since early morning in a nobleman&rsquo;s uniform that had become too tight for him.</p>",
  "page-306": "<p> He was agitated; this extraordinary gathering not only of nobles but also of the merchant-class&mdash;les états généraux (States-General)&mdash;evoked in him a whole series of ideas he had long laid aside but which were deeply graven in his soul: thoughts of the Contrat Social and the French Revolution. The words that had struck him in the Emperor&rsquo;s appeal&mdash;that the sovereign was coming to the capital for consultation with his people&mdash;strengthened this idea. And imagining that in this direction something important which he had long awaited was drawing near, he strolled about watching and listening to conversations, but nowhere finding any confirmation of the ideas that occupied him.</p><p>The Emperor&rsquo;s manifesto was read, evoking enthusiasm, and then all moved about discussing it.</p>",
  "page-307": "<p> Besides the ordinary topics of conversation, Pierre heard questions of where the marshals of the nobility were to stand when the Emperor entered, when a ball should be given in the Emperor&rsquo;s honor, whether they should group themselves by districts or by whole provinces... and so on; but as soon as the war was touched on, or what the nobility had been convened for, the talk became undecided and indefinite. Then all preferred listening to speaking.</p><p>A middle-aged man, handsome and virile, in the uniform of a retired naval officer, was speaking in one of the rooms, and a small crowd was pressing round him. Pierre went up to the circle that had formed round the speaker and listened. Count Ilyá Rostóv, in a military uniform of Catherine&rsquo;s time, was sauntering with a pleasant smile among the crowd, with all of whom he was acquainted.</p>",
  "page-308": "<p> He too approached that group and listened with a kindly smile and nods of approval, as he always did, to what the speaker was saying. The retired naval man was speaking very boldly, as was evident from the expression on the faces of the listeners and from the fact that some people Pierre knew as the meekest and quietest of men walked away disapprovingly or expressed disagreement with him. Pierre pushed his way into the middle of the group, listened, and convinced himself that the man was indeed a liberal, but of views quite different from his own. The naval officer spoke in a particularly sonorous, musical, and aristocratic baritone voice, pleasantly swallowing his r&rsquo;s and generally slurring his consonants: the voice of a man calling out to his servant, &ldquo;Heah! Bwing me my pipe!&rdquo; It was indicative of dissipation and the exercise of authority.</p>",
  "page-309": "<p>&ldquo;What if the Smolénsk people have offahd to waise militia for the Empewah? Ah we to take Smolénsk as our patte&rsquo;n? If the noble awistocwacy of the pwovince of Moscow thinks fit, it can show its loyalty to our sov&rsquo;weign the Empewah in other ways. Have we fo&rsquo;gotten the waising of the militia in the yeah &lsquo;seven? All that did was to enwich the pwiests&rsquo; sons and thieves and wobbahs....&rdquo;</p><p>Count Ilyá Rostóv smiled blandly and nodded approval.</p><p>&ldquo;And was our militia of any use to the Empia? Not at all! It only wuined our farming! Bettah have another conscwiption... o&rsquo; ou&rsquo; men will wetu&rsquo;n neithah soldiers no&rsquo; peasants, and we&rsquo;ll get only depwavity fwom them.</p>",
  "page-310": "<p> The nobility don&rsquo;t gwudge theah lives&mdash;evewy one of us will go and bwing in more wecwuits, and the sov&rsquo;weign&rdquo; (that was the way he referred to the Emperor) &ldquo;need only say the word and we&rsquo;ll all die fo&rsquo; him!&rdquo; added the orator with animation.</p><p>Count Rostóv&rsquo;s mouth watered with pleasure and he nudged Pierre, but Pierre wanted to speak himself. He pushed forward, feeling stirred, but not yet sure what stirred him or what he would say. Scarcely had he opened his mouth when one of the senators, a man without a tooth in his head, with a shrewd though angry expression, standing near the first speaker, interrupted him. Evidently accustomed to managing debates and to maintaining an argument, he began in low but distinct tones:</p>",
  "page-311": "<p>&ldquo;I imagine, sir,&rdquo; said he, mumbling with his toothless mouth, &ldquo;that we have been summoned here not to discuss whether it&rsquo;s best for the empire at the present moment to adopt conscription or to call out the militia. We have been summoned to reply to the appeal with which our sovereign the Emperor has honored us. But to judge what is best&mdash;conscription or the militia&mdash;we can leave to the supreme authority....&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre suddenly saw an outlet for his excitement. He hardened his heart against the senator who was introducing this set and narrow attitude into the deliberations of the nobility. Pierre stepped forward and interrupted him. He himself did not yet know what he would say, but he began to speak eagerly, occasionally lapsing into French or expressing himself in bookish Russian.</p>",
  "page-312": "<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, your excellency,&rdquo; he began. (He was well acquainted with the senator, but thought it necessary on this occasion to address him formally.) &ldquo;Though I don&rsquo;t agree with the gentleman...&rdquo; (he hesitated: he wished to say, &ldquo;Mon très honorable préopinant&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;My very honorable opponent&rdquo;) &ldquo;with the gentleman... whom I have not the honor of knowing, I suppose that the nobility have been summoned not merely to express their sympathy and enthusiasm but also to consider the means by which we can assist our Fatherland! I imagine,&rdquo; he went on, warming to his subject, &ldquo;that the Emperor himself would not be satisfied to find in us merely owners of serfs whom we are willing to devote to his service, and chair à canon * we are ready to make of ourselves&mdash;and not to obtain from us any co-co-counsel.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-313": "<p>Many persons withdrew from the circle, noticing the senator&rsquo;s sarcastic smile and the freedom of Pierre&rsquo;s remarks. Only Count Rostóv was pleased with them as he had been pleased with those of the naval officer, the senator, and in general with whatever speech he had last heard.</p><p>&ldquo;I think that before discussing these questions,&rdquo; Pierre continued, &ldquo;we should ask the Emperor&mdash;most respectfully ask His Majesty&mdash;to let us know the number of our troops and the position in which our army and our forces now are, and then...&rdquo;</p><p>But scarcely had Pierre uttered these words before he was attacked from three sides. The most vigorous attack came from an old acquaintance, a boston player who had always been well disposed toward him, Stepán Stepánovich Adráksin.</p>",
  "page-314": "<p> Adráksin was in uniform, and whether as a result of the uniform or from some other cause Pierre saw before him quite a different man. With a sudden expression of malevolence on his aged face, Adráksin shouted at Pierre:</p><p>&ldquo;In the first place, I tell you we have no right to question the Emperor about that, and secondly, if the Russian nobility had that right, the Emperor could not answer such a question. The troops are moved according to the enemy&rsquo;s movements and the number of men increases and decreases....&rdquo;</p><p>Another voice, that of a nobleman of medium height and about forty years of age, whom Pierre had formerly met at the gypsies&rsquo; and knew as a bad cardplayer, and who, also transformed by his uniform, came up to Pierre, interrupted Adráksin.</p>",
  "page-315": "<p>&ldquo;Yes, and this is not a time for discussing,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;but for acting: there is war in Russia! The enemy is advancing to destroy Russia, to desecrate the tombs of our fathers, to carry off our wives and children.&rdquo; The nobleman smote his breast. &ldquo;We will all arise, everyone of us will go, for our father the Tsar!&rdquo; he shouted, rolling his bloodshot eyes. Several approving voices were heard in the crowd. &ldquo;We are Russians and will not grudge our blood in defense of our faith, the throne, and the Fatherland! We must cease raving if we are sons of our Fatherland! We will show Europe how Russia rises to the defense of Russia!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-316": "<p>Pierre wished to reply, but could not get in a word. He felt that his words, apart from what meaning they conveyed, were less audible than the sound of his opponent&rsquo;s voice.</p><p>Count Rostóv at the back of the crowd was expressing approval; several persons, briskly turning a shoulder to the orator at the end of a phrase, said:</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, quite right! Just so!&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre wished to say that he was ready to sacrifice his money, his serfs, or himself, only one ought to know the state of affairs in order to be able to improve it, but he was unable to speak. Many voices shouted and talked at the same time, so that Count Rostóv had not time to signify his approval of them all, and the group increased, dispersed, re-formed, and then moved with a hum of talk into the largest hall and to the big table.</p>",
  "page-317": "<p> Not only was Pierre&rsquo;s attempt to speak unsuccessful, but he was rudely interrupted, pushed aside, and people turned away from him as from a common enemy. This happened not because they were displeased by the substance of his speech, which had even been forgotten after the many subsequent speeches, but to animate it the crowd needed a tangible object to love and a tangible object to hate. Pierre became the latter. Many other orators spoke after the excited nobleman, and all in the same tone. Many spoke eloquently and with originality.</p><p>Glínka, the editor of the Russian Messenger, who was recognized (cries of &ldquo;author! author!&rdquo; were heard in the crowd), said that &ldquo;hell must be repulsed by hell,&rdquo; and that he had seen a child smiling at lightning flashes and thunderclaps, but &ldquo;we will not be that child.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-318": "<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, at thunderclaps!&rdquo; was repeated approvingly in the back rows of the crowd.</p><p>The crowd drew up to the large table, at which sat gray-haired or bald seventy-year-old magnates, uniformed and besashed almost all of whom Pierre had seen in their own homes with their buffoons, or playing boston at the clubs. With an incessant hum of voices the crowd advanced to the table. Pressed by the throng against the high backs of the chairs, the orators spoke one after another and sometimes two together. Those standing behind noticed what a speaker omitted to say and hastened to supply it. Others in that heat and crush racked their brains to find some thought and hastened to utter it. The old magnates, whom Pierre knew, sat and turned to look first at one and then at another, and their faces for the most part only expressed the fact that they found it very hot.</p>",
  "page-319": "<p> Pierre, however, felt excited, and the general desire to show that they were ready to go to all lengths&mdash;which found expression in the tones and looks more than in the substance of the speeches&mdash;infected him too. He did not renounce his opinions, but felt himself in some way to blame and wished to justify himself.</p><p>&ldquo;I only said that it would be more to the purpose to make sacrifices when we know what is needed!&rdquo; said he, trying to be heard above the other voices.</p><p>One of the old men nearest to him looked round, but his attention was immediately diverted by an exclamation at the other side of the table.</p>",
  "page-320": "<p>&ldquo;Yes, Moscow will be surrendered! She will be our expiation!&rdquo; shouted one man.</p><p>&ldquo;He is the enemy of mankind!&rdquo; cried another. &ldquo;Allow me to speak....&rdquo; &ldquo;Gentlemen, you are crushing me!...&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-321": "<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>",
  "page-322": "<p>At that moment Count Rostopchín with his protruding chin and alert eyes, wearing the uniform of a general with sash over his shoulder, entered the room, stepping briskly to the front of the crowd of gentry.</p><p>&ldquo;Our sovereign the Emperor will be here in a moment,&rdquo; said Rostopchín. &ldquo;I am straight from the palace. Seeing the position we are in, I think there is little need for discussion. The Emperor has deigned to summon us and the merchants. Millions will pour forth from there&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed to the merchants&rsquo; hall&mdash;&ldquo;but our business is to supply men and not spare ourselves.... That is the least we can do!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-323": "<p>A conference took place confined to the magnates sitting at the table. The whole consultation passed more than quietly. After all the preceding noise the sound of their old voices saying one after another, &ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; or for variety, &ldquo;I too am of that opinion,&rdquo; and so on had even a mournful effect.</p><p>The secretary was told to write down the resolution of the Moscow nobility and gentry, that they would furnish ten men, fully equipped, out of every thousand serfs, as the Smolénsk gentry had done. Their chairs made a scraping noise as the gentlemen who had conferred rose with apparent relief, and began walking up and down, arm in arm, to stretch their legs and converse in couples.</p>",
  "page-324": "<p>&ldquo;The Emperor! The Emperor!&rdquo; a sudden cry resounded through the halls and the whole throng hurried to the entrance.</p><p>The Emperor entered the hall through a broad path between two lines of nobles. Every face expressed respectful, awe-struck curiosity. Pierre stood rather far off and could not hear all that the Emperor said. From what he did hear he understood that the Emperor spoke of the danger threatening the empire and of the hopes he placed on the Moscow nobility. He was answered by a voice which informed him of the resolution just arrived at.</p><p>&ldquo;Gentlemen!&rdquo; said the Emperor with a quivering voice.</p><p>There was a rustling among the crowd and it again subsided, so that Pierre distinctly heard the pleasantly human voice of the Emperor saying with emotion:</p>",
  "page-325": "<p>&ldquo;I never doubted the devotion of the Russian nobles, but today it has surpassed my expectations. I thank you in the name of the Fatherland! Gentlemen, let us act! Time is most precious....&rdquo;</p><p>The Emperor ceased speaking, the crowd began pressing round him, and rapturous exclamations were heard from all sides.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, most precious... a royal word,&rdquo; said Count Rostóv, with a sob. He stood at the back, and, though he had heard hardly anything, understood everything in his own way.</p><p>From the hall of the nobility the Emperor went to that of the merchants. There he remained about ten minutes. Pierre was among those who saw him come out from the merchants&rsquo; hall with tears of emotion in his eyes. As became known later, he had scarcely begun to address the merchants before tears gushed from his eyes and he concluded in a trembling voice.</p>",
  "page-326": "<p> When Pierre saw the Emperor he was coming out accompanied by two merchants, one of whom Pierre knew, a fat otkupshchík. The other was the mayor, a man with a thin sallow face and narrow beard. Both were weeping. Tears filled the thin man&rsquo;s eyes, and the fat otkupshchík sobbed outright like a child and kept repeating:</p><p>&ldquo;Our lives and property&mdash;take them, Your Majesty!&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre&rsquo;s one feeling at the moment was a desire to show that he was ready to go all lengths and was prepared to sacrifice everything. He now felt ashamed of his speech with its constitutional tendency and sought an opportunity of effacing it. Having heard that Count Mamónov was furnishing a regiment, Bezúkhov at once informed Rostopchín that he would give a thousand men and their maintenance.</p>",
  "page-327": "<p>Old Rostóv could not tell his wife of what had passed without tears, and at once consented to Pétya&rsquo;s request and went himself to enter his name.</p><p>Next day the Emperor left Moscow. The assembled nobles all took off their uniforms and settled down again in their homes and clubs, and not without some groans gave orders to their stewards about the enrollment, feeling amazed themselves at what they had done.</p>",

  "page-330": "<p>Napoleon began the war with Russia because he could not resist going to Dresden, could not help having his head turned by the homage he received, could not help donning a Polish uniform and yielding to the stimulating influence of a June morning, and could not refrain from bursts of anger in the presence of Kurákin and then of Balashëv.</p><p>Alexander refused negotiations because he felt himself to be personally insulted. Barclay de Tolly tried to command the army in the best way, because he wished to fulfill his duty and earn fame as a great commander. Rostóv charged the French because he could not restrain his wish for a gallop across a level field; and in the same way the innumerable people who took part in the war acted in accord with their personal characteristics, habits, circumstances, and aims.</p>",
  "page-331": "<p> They were moved by fear or vanity, rejoiced or were indignant, reasoned, imagining that they knew what they were doing and did it of their own free will, but they all were involuntary tools of history, carrying on a work concealed from them but comprehensible to us. Such is the inevitable fate of men of action, and the higher they stand in the social hierarchy the less are they free.</p><p>The actors of 1812 have long since left the stage, their personal interests have vanished leaving no trace, and nothing remains of that time but its historic results.</p><p>Providence compelled all these men, striving to attain personal aims, to further the accomplishment of a stupendous result no one of them at all expected&mdash;neither Napoleon, nor Alexander, nor still less any of those who did the actual fighting.</p>",
  "page-332": "<p>The cause of the destruction of the French army in 1812 is clear to us now. No one will deny that that cause was, on the one hand, its advance into the heart of Russia late in the season without any preparation for a winter campaign and, on the other, the character given to the war by the burning of Russian towns and the hatred of the foe this aroused among the Russian people. But no one at the time foresaw (what now seems so evident) that this was the only way an army of eight hundred thousand men&mdash;the best in the world and led by the best general&mdash;could be destroyed in conflict with a raw army of half its numerical strength, and led by inexperienced commanders as the Russian army was.</p>",
  "page-333": "<p> Not only did no one see this, but on the Russian side every effort was made to hinder the only thing that could save Russia, while on the French side, despite Napoleon&rsquo;s experience and so-called military genius, every effort was directed to pushing on to Moscow at the end of the summer, that is, to doing the very thing that was bound to lead to destruction.</p><p>In historical works on the year 1812 French writers are very fond of saying that Napoleon felt the danger of extending his line, that he sought a battle and that his marshals advised him to stop at Smolénsk, and of making similar statements to show that the danger of the campaign was even then understood.</p>",
  "page-334": "<p> Russian authors are still fonder of telling us that from the commencement of the campaign a Scythian war plan was adopted to lure Napoleon into the depths of Russia, and this plan some of them attribute to Pfuel, others to a certain Frenchman, others to Toll, and others again to Alexander himself&mdash;pointing to notes, projects, and letters which contain hints of such a line of action. But all these hints at what happened, both from the French side and the Russian, are advanced only because they fit in with the event. Had that event not occurred these hints would have been forgotten, as we have forgotten the thousands and millions of hints and expectations to the contrary which were current then but have now been forgotten because the event falsified them. There are always so many conjectures as to the issue of any event that however it may end there will always be people to say: &ldquo;</p>",
  "page-335": "<p>I said then that it would be so,&rdquo; quite forgetting that amid their innumerable conjectures many were to quite the contrary effect.</p><p>Conjectures as to Napoleon&rsquo;s awareness of the danger of extending his line, and (on the Russian side) as to luring the enemy into the depths of Russia, are evidently of that kind, and only by much straining can historians attribute such conceptions to Napoleon and his marshals, or such plans to the Russian commanders. All the facts are in flat contradiction to such conjectures. During the whole period of the war not only was there no wish on the Russian side to draw the French into the heart of the country, but from their first entry into Russia everything was done to stop them. And not only was Napoleon not afraid to extend his line, but he welcomed every step forward as a triumph and did not seek battle as eagerly as in former campaigns, but very lazily.</p>",
  "page-336": "<p>At the very beginning of the war our armies were divided, and our sole aim was to unite them, though uniting the armies was no advantage if we meant to retire and lure the enemy into the depths of the country. Our Emperor joined the army to encourage it to defend every inch of Russian soil and not to retreat. The enormous Drissa camp was formed on Pfuel&rsquo;s plan, and there was no intention of retiring farther. The Emperor reproached the commanders in chief for every step they retired. He could not bear the idea of letting the enemy even reach Smolénsk, still less could he contemplate the burning of Moscow, and when our armies did unite he was displeased that Smolénsk was abandoned and burned without a general engagement having been fought under its walls.</p>",
  "page-337": "<p>So thought the Emperor, and the Russian commanders and people were still more provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating into the depths of the country.</p><p>Napoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into the country and missed several chances of forcing an engagement. In August he was at Smolénsk and thought only of how to advance farther, though as we now see that advance was evidently ruinous to him.</p><p>The facts clearly show that Napoleon did not foresee the danger of the advance on Moscow, nor did Alexander and the Russian commanders then think of luring Napoleon on, but quite the contrary. The luring of Napoleon into the depths of the country was not the result of any plan, for no one believed it to be possible; it resulted from a most complex interplay of intrigues, aims, and wishes among those who took part in the war and had no perception whatever of the inevitable, or of the one way of saving Russia.</p>",
  "page-338": "<p> Everything came about fortuitously. The armies were divided at the commencement of the campaign. We tried to unite them, with the evident intention of giving battle and checking the enemy&rsquo;s advance, and by this effort to unite them while avoiding battle with a much stronger enemy, and necessarily withdrawing the armies at an acute angle&mdash;we led the French on to Smolénsk. But we withdrew at an acute angle not only because the French advanced between our two armies; the angle became still more acute and we withdrew still farther, because Barclay de Tolly was an unpopular foreigner disliked by Bagratión (who would come under his command), and Bagratión&mdash;being in command of the second army&mdash;tried to postpone joining up and coming under Barclay&rsquo;s command as long as he could.</p>",
  "page-339": "<p> Bagratión was slow in effecting the junction&mdash;though that was the chief aim of all at headquarters&mdash;because, as he alleged, he exposed his army to danger on this march, and it was best for him to retire more to the left and more to the south, worrying the enemy from flank and rear and securing from the Ukraine recruits for his army; and it looks as if he planned this in order not to come under the command of the detested foreigner Barclay, whose rank was inferior to his own.</p><p>The Emperor was with the army to encourage it, but his presence and ignorance of what steps to take, and the enormous number of advisers and plans, destroyed the first army&rsquo;s energy and it retired.</p>",
  "page-340": "<p>The intention was to make a stand at the Drissa camp, but Paulucci, aiming at becoming commander in chief, unexpectedly employed his energy to influence Alexander, and Pfuel&rsquo;s whole plan was abandoned and the command entrusted to Barclay. But as Barclay did not inspire confidence his power was limited. The armies were divided, there was no unity of command, and Barclay was unpopular; but from this confusion, division, and the unpopularity of the foreign commander in chief, there resulted on the one hand indecision and the avoidance of a battle (which we could not have refrained from had the armies been united and had someone else, instead of Barclay, been in command) and on the other an ever-increasing indignation against the foreigners and an increase in patriotic zeal.</p>",
  "page-341": "<p>At last the Emperor left the army, and as the most convenient and indeed the only pretext for his departure it was decided that it was necessary for him to inspire the people in the capitals and arouse the nation in general to a patriotic war. And by this visit of the Emperor to Moscow the strength of the Russian army was trebled.</p><p>He left in order not to obstruct the commander in chief&rsquo;s undivided control of the army, and hoping that more decisive action would then be taken, but the command of the armies became still more confused and enfeebled. Bennigsen, the Tsarévich, and a swarm of adjutants general remained with the army to keep the commander in chief under observation and arouse his energy, and Barclay, feeling less free than ever under the observation of all these &ldquo;eyes of the Emperor,&rdquo; became still more cautious of undertaking any decisive action and avoided giving battle.</p>",
  "page-342": "<p>Barclay stood for caution. The Tsarévich hinted at treachery and demanded a general engagement. Lubomírski, Bronnítski, Wlocki, and the others of that group stirred up so much trouble that Barclay, under pretext of sending papers to the Emperor, dispatched these Polish adjutants general to Petersburg and plunged into an open struggle with Bennigsen and the Tsarévich.</p><p>At Smolénsk the armies at last reunited, much as Bagratión disliked it.</p><p>Bagratión drove up in a carriage to the house occupied by Barclay. Barclay donned his sash and came out to meet and report to his senior officer Bagratión.</p><p>Despite his seniority in rank Bagratión, in this contest of magnanimity, took his orders from Barclay, but, having submitted, agreed with him less than ever. By the Emperor&rsquo;s orders Bagratión reported direct to him.</p>",
  "page-343": "<p> He wrote to Arakchéev, the Emperor&rsquo;s confidant: &ldquo;It must be as my sovereign pleases, but I cannot work with the Minister (meaning Barclay). For God&rsquo;s sake send me somewhere else if only in command of a regiment. I cannot stand it here. Headquarters are so full of Germans that a Russian cannot exist and there is no sense in anything. I thought I was really serving my sovereign and the Fatherland, but it turns out that I am serving Barclay. I confess I do not want to.&rdquo;</p><p>The swarm of Bronnítskis and Wintzingerodes and their like still further embittered the relations between the commanders in chief, and even less unity resulted. Preparations were made to fight the French before Smolénsk. A general was sent to survey the position.</p>",
  "page-344": "<p> This general, hating Barclay, rode to visit a friend of his own, a corps commander, and, having spent the day with him, returned to Barclay and condemned, as unsuitable from every point of view, the battleground he had not seen.</p><p>While disputes and intrigues were going on about the future field of battle, and while we were looking for the French&mdash;having lost touch with them&mdash;the French stumbled upon Nevérovski&rsquo;s division and reached the walls of Smolénsk.</p><p>It was necessary to fight an unexpected battle at Smolénsk to save our lines of communication. The battle was fought and thousands were killed on both sides.</p>",
  "page-345": "<p>Smolénsk was abandoned contrary to the wishes of the Emperor and of the whole people. But Smolénsk was burned by its own inhabitants who had been misled by their governor. And these ruined inhabitants, setting an example to other Russians, went to Moscow thinking only of their own losses but kindling hatred of the foe. Napoleon advanced farther and we retired, thus arriving at the very result which caused his destruction.</p>",

  "page-347": "<p>The day after his son had left, Prince Nicholas sent for Princess Mary to come to his study.</p><p>&ldquo;Well? Are you satisfied now?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made me quarrel with my son! Satisfied, are you? That&rsquo;s all you wanted! Satisfied?... It hurts me, it hurts. I&rsquo;m old and weak and this is what you wanted. Well then, gloat over it! Gloat over it!&rdquo;</p><p>After that Princess Mary did not see her father for a whole week. He was ill and did not leave his study.</p><p>Princess Mary noticed to her surprise that during this illness the old prince not only excluded her from his room, but did not admit Mademoiselle Bourienne either. Tíkhon alone attended him.</p>",
  "page-348": "<p>At the end of the week the prince reappeared and resumed his former way of life, devoting himself with special activity to building operations and the arrangement of the gardens and completely breaking off his relations with Mademoiselle Bourienne. His looks and cold tone to his daughter seemed to say: &ldquo;There, you see? You plotted against me, you lied to Prince Andrew about my relations with that Frenchwoman and made me quarrel with him, but you see I need neither her nor you!&rdquo;</p><p>Princess Mary spent half of every day with little Nicholas, watching his lessons, teaching him Russian and music herself, and talking to Dessalles; the rest of the day she spent over her books, with her old nurse, or with &ldquo;God&rsquo;s folk&rdquo; who sometimes came by the back door to see her.</p>",
  "page-349": "<p>Of the war Princess Mary thought as women do think about wars. She feared for her brother who was in it, was horrified by and amazed at the strange cruelty that impels men to kill one another, but she did not understand the significance of this war, which seemed to her like all previous wars. She did not realize the significance of this war, though Dessalles with whom she constantly conversed was passionately interested in its progress and tried to explain his own conception of it to her, and though the &ldquo;God&rsquo;s folk&rdquo; who came to see her reported, in their own way, the rumors current among the people of an invasion by Antichrist, and though Julie (now Princess Drubetskáya), who had resumed correspondence with her, wrote patriotic letters from Moscow.</p>",
  "page-350": "<p>&ldquo;I write you in Russian, my good friend,&rdquo; wrote Julie in her Frenchified Russian, &ldquo;because I have a detestation for all the French, and the same for their language which I cannot support to hear spoken.... We in Moscow are elated by enthusiasm for our adored Emperor.</p><p>&ldquo;My poor husband is enduring pains and hunger in Jewish taverns, but the news which I have inspires me yet more.</p><p>&ldquo;You heard probably of the heroic exploit of Raévski, embracing his two sons and saying: &lsquo;I will perish with them but we will not be shaken!&rsquo; And truly though the enemy was twice stronger than we, we were unshakable. We pass the time as we can, but in war as in war! The princesses Aline and Sophie sit whole days with me, and we, unhappy widows of live men, make beautiful conversations over our charpie, only you, my friend, are missing...&rdquo; and so on.</p>",
  "page-351": "<p>The chief reason Princess Mary did not realize the full significance of this war was that the old prince never spoke of it, did not recognize it, and laughed at Dessalles when he mentioned it at dinner. The prince&rsquo;s tone was so calm and confident that Princess Mary unhesitatingly believed him.</p><p>All that July the old prince was exceedingly active and even animated. He planned another garden and began a new building for the domestic serfs. The only thing that made Princess Mary anxious about him was that he slept very little and, instead of sleeping in his study as usual, changed his sleeping place every day. One day he would order his camp bed to be set up in the glass gallery, another day he remained on the couch or on the lounge chair in the drawing room and dozed there without undressing, while&mdash;instead of Mademoiselle Bourienne&mdash;a serf boy read to him. Then again he would spend a night in the dining room.</p>",
  "page-352": "<p>On August 1, a second letter was received from Prince Andrew. In his first letter which came soon after he had left home, Prince Andrew had dutifully asked his father&rsquo;s forgiveness for what he had allowed himself to say and begged to be restored to his favor. To this letter the old prince had replied affectionately, and from that time had kept the Frenchwoman at a distance. Prince Andrew&rsquo;s second letter, written near Vítebsk after the French had occupied that town, gave a brief account of the whole campaign, enclosed for them a plan he had drawn and forecasts as to the further progress of the war. In this letter Prince Andrew pointed out to his father the danger of staying at Bald Hills, so near the theater of war and on the army&rsquo;s direct line of march, and advised him to move to Moscow.</p>",
  "page-353": "<p>At dinner that day, on Dessalles&rsquo; mentioning that the French were said to have already entered Vítebsk, the old prince remembered his son&rsquo;s letter.</p><p>&ldquo;There was a letter from Prince Andrew today,&rdquo; he said to Princess Mary&mdash;&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you read it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Father,&rdquo; she replied in a frightened voice.</p><p>She could not have read the letter as she did not even know it had arrived.</p><p>&ldquo;He writes about this war,&rdquo; said the prince, with the ironic smile that had become habitual to him in speaking of the present war.</p>",
  "page-354": "<p>&ldquo;That must be very interesting,&rdquo; said Dessalles. &ldquo;Prince Andrew is in a position to know...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, very interesting!&rdquo; said Mademoiselle Bourienne.</p><p>&ldquo;Go and get it for me,&rdquo; said the old prince to Mademoiselle Bourienne. &ldquo;You know&mdash;under the paperweight on the little table.&rdquo;</p><p>Mademoiselle Bourienne jumped up eagerly.</p><p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he exclaimed with a frown. &ldquo;You go, Michael Ivánovich.&rdquo;</p><p>Michael Ivánovich rose and went to the study. But as soon as he had left the room the old prince, looking uneasily round, threw down his napkin and went himself.</p>",
  "page-355": "<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t do anything... always make some muddle,&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p>While he was away Princess Mary, Dessalles, Mademoiselle Bourienne, and even little Nicholas exchanged looks in silence. The old prince returned with quick steps, accompanied by Michael Ivánovich, bringing the letter and a plan. These he put down beside him&mdash;not letting anyone read them at dinner.</p><p>On moving to the drawing room he handed the letter to Princess Mary and, spreading out before him the plan of the new building and fixing his eyes upon it, told her to read the letter aloud. When she had done so Princess Mary looked inquiringly at her father. He was examining the plan, evidently engrossed in his own ideas.</p>",
  "page-356": "<p>&ldquo;What do you think of it, Prince?&rdquo; Dessalles ventured to ask.</p><p>&ldquo;I? I?...&rdquo; said the prince as if unpleasantly awakened, and not taking his eyes from the plan of the building.</p><p>&ldquo;Very possibly the theater of war will move so near to us that...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha! The theater of war!&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;I have said and still say that the theater of war is Poland and the enemy will never get beyond the Niemen.&rdquo;</p><p>Dessalles looked in amazement at the prince, who was talking of the Niemen when the enemy was already at the Dnieper, but Princess Mary, forgetting the geographical position of the Niemen, thought that what her father was saying was correct.</p>",
  "page-357": "<p>&ldquo;When the snow melts they&rsquo;ll sink in the Polish swamps. Only they could fail to see it,&rdquo; the prince continued, evidently thinking of the campaign of 1807 which seemed to him so recent. &ldquo;Bennigsen should have advanced into Prussia sooner, then things would have taken a different turn...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But, Prince,&rdquo; Dessalles began timidly, &ldquo;the letter mentions Vítebsk....&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, the letter? Yes...&rdquo; replied the prince peevishly. &ldquo;Yes... yes...&rdquo; His face suddenly took on a morose expression. He paused. &ldquo;Yes, he writes that the French were beaten at... at... what river is it?&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-358": "<p>Dessalles dropped his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;The prince says nothing about that,&rdquo; he remarked gently.</p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he? But I didn&rsquo;t invent it myself.&rdquo;</p><p>No one spoke for a long time.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes... yes... Well, Michael Ivánovich,&rdquo; he suddenly went on, raising his head and pointing to the plan of the building, &ldquo;tell me how you mean to alter it....&rdquo;</p><p>Michael Ivánovich went up to the plan, and the prince after speaking to him about the building looked angrily at Princess Mary and Dessalles and went to his own room.</p>",
  "page-359": "<p>Princess Mary saw Dessalles&rsquo; embarrassed and astonished look fixed on her father, noticed his silence, and was struck by the fact that her father had forgotten his son&rsquo;s letter on the drawing room table; but she was not only afraid to speak of it and ask Dessalles the reason of his confusion and silence, but was afraid even to think about it.</p><p>In the evening Michael Ivánovich, sent by the prince, came to Princess Mary for Prince Andrew&rsquo;s letter which had been forgotten in the drawing room. She gave it to him and, unpleasant as it was to her to do so, ventured to ask him what her father was doing.</p><p>&ldquo;Always busy,&rdquo; replied Michael Ivánovich with a respectfully ironic smile which caused Princess Mary to turn pale. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s worrying very much about the new building.</p>",
  "page-360": "<p> He has been reading a little, but now&rdquo;&mdash;Michael Ivánovich went on, lowering his voice&mdash;&ldquo;now he&rsquo;s at his desk, busy with his will, I expect.&rdquo; (One of the prince&rsquo;s favorite occupations of late had been the preparation of some papers he meant to leave at his death and which he called his &ldquo;will.&rdquo;)</p><p>&ldquo;And Alpátych is being sent to Smolénsk?&rdquo; asked Princess Mary.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, he has been waiting to start for some time.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-361": "<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>",
  "page-362": "<p>When Michael Ivánovich returned to the study with the letter, the old prince, with spectacles on and a shade over his eyes, was sitting at his open bureau with screened candles, holding a paper in his outstretched hand, and in a somewhat dramatic attitude was reading his manuscript&mdash;his &ldquo;Remarks&rdquo; as he termed it&mdash;which was to be transmitted to the Emperor after his death.</p><p>When Michael Ivánovich went in there were tears in the prince&rsquo;s eyes evoked by the memory of the time when the paper he was now reading had been written. He took the letter from Michael Ivánovich&rsquo;s hand, put it in his pocket, folded up his papers, and called in Alpátych who had long been waiting.</p>",
  "page-363": "<p>The prince had a list of things to be bought in Smolénsk and, walking up and down the room past Alpátych who stood by the door, he gave his instructions.</p><p>&ldquo;First, notepaper&mdash;do you hear? Eight quires, like this sample, gilt-edged... it must be exactly like the sample. Varnish, sealing wax, as in Michael Ivánovich&rsquo;s list.&rdquo;</p><p>He paced up and down for a while and glanced at his notes.</p><p>&ldquo;Then hand to the governor in person a letter about the deed.&rdquo;</p><p>Next, bolts for the doors of the new building were wanted and had to be of a special shape the prince had himself designed, and a leather case had to be ordered to keep the &ldquo;will&rdquo; in.</p>",
  "page-364": "<p>The instructions to Alpátych took over two hours and still the prince did not let him go. He sat down, sank into thought, closed his eyes, and dozed off. Alpátych made a slight movement.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, go, go! If anything more is wanted I&rsquo;ll send after you.&rdquo;</p><p>Alpátych went out. The prince again went to his bureau, glanced into it, fingered his papers, closed the bureau again, and sat down at the table to write to the governor.</p><p>It was already late when he rose after sealing the letter. He wished to sleep, but he knew he would not be able to and that most depressing thoughts came to him in bed. So he called Tíkhon and went through the rooms with him to show him where to set up the bed for that night.</p>",
  "page-365": "<p>He went about looking at every corner. Every place seemed unsatisfactory, but worst of all was his customary couch in the study. That couch was dreadful to him, probably because of the oppressive thoughts he had had when lying there. It was unsatisfactory everywhere, but the corner behind the piano in the sitting room was better than other places: he had never slept there yet.</p><p>With the help of a footman Tíkhon brought in the bedstead and began putting it up.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not right! That&rsquo;s not right!&rdquo; cried the prince, and himself pushed it a few inches from the corner and then closer in again.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, at last I&rsquo;ve finished, now I&rsquo;ll rest,&rdquo; thought the prince, and let Tíkhon undress him.</p>",
  "page-366": "<p>Frowning with vexation at the effort necessary to divest himself of his coat and trousers, the prince undressed, sat down heavily on the bed, and appeared to be meditating as he looked contemptuously at his withered yellow legs. He was not meditating, but only deferring the moment of making the effort to lift those legs up and turn over on the bed. &ldquo;Ugh, how hard it is! Oh, that this toil might end and you would release me!&rdquo; thought he. Pressing his lips together he made that effort for the twenty-thousandth time and lay down. But hardly had he done so before he felt the bed rocking backwards and forwards beneath him as if it were breathing heavily and jolting. This happened to him almost every night. He opened his eyes as they were closing.</p>",
  "page-367": "<p>&ldquo;No peace, damn them!&rdquo; he muttered, angry he knew not with whom. &ldquo;Ah yes, there was something else important, very important, that I was keeping till I should be in bed. The bolts? No, I told him about them. No, it was something, something in the drawing room. Princess Mary talked some nonsense. Dessalles, that fool, said something. Something in my pocket&mdash;can&rsquo;t remember....&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tíkhon, what did we talk about at dinner?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;About Prince Michael...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be quiet, quiet!&rdquo; The prince slapped his hand on the table. &ldquo;Yes, I know, Prince Andrew&rsquo;s letter! Princess Mary read it. Dessalles said something about Vítebsk. Now I&rsquo;ll read it.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-368": "<p>He had the letter taken from his pocket and the table&mdash;on which stood a glass of lemonade and a spiral wax candle&mdash;moved close to the bed, and putting on his spectacles he began reading. Only now in the stillness of the night, reading it by the faint light under the green shade, did he grasp its meaning for a moment.</p><p>&ldquo;The French at Vítebsk, in four days&rsquo; march they may be at Smolénsk; perhaps are already there! Tíkhon!&rdquo; Tíkhon jumped up. &ldquo;No, no, I don&rsquo;t want anything!&rdquo; he shouted.</p><p>He put the letter under the candlestick and closed his eyes. And there rose before him the Danube at bright noonday: reeds, the Russian camp, and himself a young general without a wrinkle on his ruddy face, vigorous and alert, entering Potëmkin&rsquo;</p>",
  "page-369": "<p>s gaily colored tent, and a burning sense of jealousy of &ldquo;the favorite&rdquo; agitated him now as strongly as it had done then. He recalled all the words spoken at that first meeting with Potëmkin. And he saw before him a plump, rather sallow-faced, short, stout woman, the Empress Mother, with her smile and her words at her first gracious reception of him, and then that same face on the catafalque, and the encounter he had with Zúbov over her coffin about his right to kiss her hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, quicker, quicker! To get back to that time and have done with all the present! Quicker, quicker&mdash;and that they should leave me in peace!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-370": "<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>",
  "page-371": "<p>Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas Bolkónski&rsquo;s estate, lay forty miles east from Smolénsk and two miles from the main road to Moscow.</p><p>The same evening that the prince gave his instructions to Alpátych, Dessalles, having asked to see Princess Mary, told her that, as the prince was not very well and was taking no steps to secure his safety, though from Prince Andrew&rsquo;s letter it was evident that to remain at Bald Hills might be dangerous, he respectfully advised her to send a letter by Alpátych to the Provincial Governor at Smolénsk, asking him to let her know the state of affairs and the extent of the danger to which Bald Hills was exposed. Dessalles wrote this letter to the Governor for Princess Mary, she signed it, and it was given to Alpátych with instructions to hand it to the Governor and to come back as quickly as possible if there was danger.</p>",
  "page-372": "<p>Having received all his orders Alpátych, wearing a white beaver hat&mdash;a present from the prince&mdash;and carrying a stick as the prince did, went out accompanied by his family. Three well-fed roans stood ready harnessed to a small conveyance with a leather hood.</p><p>The larger bell was muffled and the little bells on the harness stuffed with paper. The prince allowed no one at Bald Hills to drive with ringing bells; but on a long journey Alpátych liked to have them. His satellites&mdash;the senior clerk, a countinghouse clerk, a scullery maid, a cook, two old women, a little pageboy, the coachman, and various domestic serfs&mdash;were seeing him off.</p>",
  "page-373": "<p>His daughter placed chintz-covered down cushions for him to sit on and behind his back. His old sister-in-law popped in a small bundle, and one of the coachmen helped him into the vehicle.</p><p>&ldquo;There! There! Women&rsquo;s fuss! Women, women!&rdquo; said Alpátych, puffing and speaking rapidly just as the prince did, and he climbed into the trap.</p><p>After giving the clerk orders about the work to be done, Alpátych, not trying to imitate the prince now, lifted the hat from his bald head and crossed himself three times.</p><p>&ldquo;If there is anything... come back, Yákov Alpátych! For Christ&rsquo;s sake think of us!&rdquo; cried his wife, referring to the rumors of war and the enemy.</p>",
  "page-374": "<p>&ldquo;Women, women! Women&rsquo;s fuss!&rdquo; muttered Alpátych to himself and started on his journey, looking round at the fields of yellow rye and the still-green, thickly growing oats, and at other quite black fields just being plowed a second time.</p><p>As he went along he looked with pleasure at the year&rsquo;s splendid crop of corn, scrutinized the strips of ryefield which here and there were already being reaped, made his calculations as to the sowing and the harvest, and asked himself whether he had not forgotten any of the prince&rsquo;s orders.</p><p>Having baited the horses twice on the way, he arrived at the town toward evening on the fourth of August.</p>",
  "page-375": "<p>Alpátych kept meeting and overtaking baggage trains and troops on the road. As he approached Smolénsk he heard the sounds of distant firing, but these did not impress him. What struck him most was the sight of a splendid field of oats in which a camp had been pitched and which was being mown down by the soldiers, evidently for fodder. This fact impressed Alpátych, but in thinking about his own business he soon forgot it.</p><p>All the interests of his life for more than thirty years had been bounded by the will of the prince, and he never went beyond that limit. Everything not connected with the execution of the prince&rsquo;s orders did not interest and did not even exist for Alpátych.</p>",
  "page-376": "<p>On reaching Smolénsk on the evening of the fourth of August he put up in the Gáchina suburb across the Dnieper, at the inn kept by Ferapóntov, where he had been in the habit of putting up for the last thirty years. Some thirty years ago Ferapóntov, by Alpátych&rsquo;s advice, had bought a wood from the prince, had begun to trade, and now had a house, an inn, and a corn dealer&rsquo;s shop in that province. He was a stout, dark, red-faced peasant in the forties, with thick lips, a broad knob of a nose, similar knobs over his black frowning brows, and a round belly.</p><p>Wearing a waistcoat over his cotton shirt, Ferapóntov was standing before his shop which opened onto the street. On seeing Alpátych he went up to him.</p>",
  "page-377": "<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome, Yákov Alpátych. Folks are leaving the town, but you have come to it,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are they leaving the town?&rdquo; asked Alpátych.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say. Folks are foolish! Always afraid of the French.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Women&rsquo;s fuss, women&rsquo;s fuss!&rdquo; said Alpátych.</p><p>&ldquo;Just what I think, Yákov Alpátych. What I say is: orders have been given not to let them in, so that must be right. And the peasants are asking three rubles for carting&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t Christian!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-378": "<p>Yákov Alpátych heard without heeding. He asked for a samovar and for hay for his horses, and when he had had his tea he went to bed.</p><p>All night long troops were moving past the inn. Next morning Alpátych donned a jacket he wore only in town and went out on business. It was a sunny morning and by eight o&rsquo;clock it was already hot. &ldquo;A good day for harvesting,&rdquo; thought Alpátych.</p><p>From beyond the town firing had been heard since early morning. At eight o&rsquo;clock the booming of cannon was added to the sound of musketry. Many people were hurrying through the streets and there were many soldiers, but cabs were still driving about, tradesmen stood at their shops, and service was being held in the churches as usual. Alpátych went to the shops, to government offices, to the post office, and to the Governor&rsquo;s.</p>",
  "page-379": "<p> In the offices and shops and at the post office everyone was talking about the army and about the enemy who was already attacking the town, everybody was asking what should be done, and all were trying to calm one another.</p><p>In front of the Governor&rsquo;s house Alpátych found a large number of people, Cossacks, and a traveling carriage of the Governor&rsquo;s. At the porch he met two of the landed gentry, one of whom he knew. This man, an ex-captain of police, was saying angrily:</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no joke, you know! It&rsquo;s all very well if you&rsquo;re single. &lsquo;One man though undone is but one,&rsquo; as the proverb says, but with thirteen in your family and all the property... They&rsquo;ve brought us to utter ruin! What sort of governors are they to do that? They ought to be hanged&mdash;the brigands!...&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-380": "<p>&ldquo;Oh come, that&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; said the other.</p><p>&ldquo;What do I care? Let him hear! We&rsquo;re not dogs,&rdquo; said the ex-captain of police, and looking round he noticed Alpátych.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Yákov Alpátych! What have you come for?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To see the Governor by his excellency&rsquo;s order,&rdquo; answered Alpátych, lifting his head and proudly thrusting his hand into the bosom of his coat as he always did when he mentioned the prince.... &ldquo;He has ordered me to inquire into the position of affairs,&rdquo; he added.</p>",
  "page-381": "<p>&ldquo;Yes, go and find out!&rdquo; shouted the angry gentleman. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve brought things to such a pass that there are no carts or anything!... There it is again, do you hear?&rdquo; said he, pointing in the direction whence came the sounds of firing.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve brought us all to ruin... the brigands!&rdquo; he repeated, and descended the porch steps.</p><p>Alpátych swayed his head and went upstairs. In the waiting room were tradesmen, women, and officials, looking silently at one another. The door of the Governor&rsquo;s room opened and they all rose and moved forward. An official ran out, said some words to a merchant, called a stout official with a cross hanging on his neck to follow him, and vanished again, evidently wishing to avoid the inquiring looks and questions addressed to him.</p>",
  "page-382": "<p> Alpátych moved forward and next time the official came out addressed him, one hand placed in the breast of his buttoned coat, and handed him two letters.</p><p>&ldquo;To his Honor Baron Asch, from General-in-Chief Prince Bolkónski,&rdquo; he announced with such solemnity and significance that the official turned to him and took the letters.</p><p>A few minutes later the Governor received Alpátych and hurriedly said to him:</p><p>&ldquo;Inform the prince and princess that I knew nothing: I acted on the highest instructions&mdash;here...&rdquo; and he handed a paper to Alpátych. &ldquo;Still, as the prince is unwell my advice is that they should go to Moscow. I am just starting myself. Inform them...&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-383": "<p>But the Governor did not finish: a dusty perspiring officer ran into the room and began to say something in French. The Governor&rsquo;s face expressed terror.</p><p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; he said, nodding his head to Alpátych, and began questioning the officer.</p><p>Eager, frightened, helpless glances were turned on Alpátych when he came out of the Governor&rsquo;s room. Involuntarily listening now to the firing, which had drawn nearer and was increasing in strength, Alpátych hurried to his inn. The paper handed to him by the Governor said this:</p><p>&ldquo;I assure you that the town of Smolénsk is not in the slightest danger as yet and it is unlikely that it will be threatened with any.</p>",
  "page-384": "<p> I from the one side and Prince Bagratión from the other are marching to unite our forces before Smolénsk, which junction will be effected on the 22nd instant, and both armies with their united forces will defend our compatriots of the province entrusted to your care till our efforts shall have beaten back the enemies of our Fatherland, or till the last warrior in our valiant ranks has perished. From this you will see that you have a perfect right to reassure the inhabitants of Smolénsk, for those defended by two such brave armies may feel assured of victory.&rdquo; (Instructions from Barclay de Tolly to Baron Asch, the civil governor of Smolénsk, 1812.)</p><p>People were anxiously roaming about the streets.</p>",
  "page-385": "<p>Carts piled high with household utensils, chairs, and cupboards kept emerging from the gates of the yards and moving along the streets. Loaded carts stood at the house next to Ferapóntov&rsquo;s and women were wailing and lamenting as they said good-by. A small watchdog ran round barking in front of the harnessed horses.</p><p>Alpátych entered the innyard at a quicker pace than usual and went straight to the shed where his horses and trap were. The coachman was asleep. He woke him up, told him to harness, and went into the passage. From the host&rsquo;s room came the sounds of a child crying, the despairing sobs of a woman, and the hoarse angry shouting of Ferapóntov. The cook began running hither and thither in the passage like a frightened hen, just as Alpátych entered.</p>",
  "page-386": "<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s done her to death. Killed the mistress!... Beat her... dragged her about so!...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked Alpátych.</p><p>&ldquo;She kept begging to go away. She&rsquo;s a woman! &lsquo;Take me away,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t let me perish with my little children! Folks,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;are all gone, so why,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t we go?&rsquo; And he began beating and pulling her about so!&rdquo;</p><p>At these words Alpátych nodded as if in approval, and not wishing to hear more went to the door of the room opposite the innkeeper&rsquo;s, where he had left his purchases.</p>",
  "page-387": "<p>&ldquo;You brute, you murderer!&rdquo; screamed a thin, pale woman who, with a baby in her arms and her kerchief torn from her head, burst through the door at that moment and down the steps into the yard.</p><p>Ferapóntov came out after her, but on seeing Alpátych adjusted his waistcoat, smoothed his hair, yawned, and followed Alpátych into the opposite room.</p><p>&ldquo;Going already?&rdquo; said he.</p><p>Alpátych, without answering or looking at his host, sorted his packages and asked how much he owed.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll reckon up! Well, have you been to the Governor&rsquo;s?&rdquo; asked Ferapóntov. &ldquo;What has been decided?&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-388": "<p>Alpátych replied that the Governor had not told him anything definite.</p><p>&ldquo;With our business, how can we get away?&rdquo; said Ferapóntov. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d have to pay seven rubles a cartload to Dorogobúzh and I tell them they&rsquo;re not Christians to ask it! Selivánov, now, did a good stroke last Thursday&mdash;sold flour to the army at nine rubles a sack. Will you have some tea?&rdquo; he added.</p><p>While the horses were being harnessed Alpátych and Ferapóntov over their tea talked of the price of corn, the crops, and the good weather for harvesting.</p>",
  "page-389": "<p>&ldquo;Well, it seems to be getting quieter,&rdquo; remarked Ferapóntov, finishing his third cup of tea and getting up. &ldquo;Ours must have got the best of it. The orders were not to let them in. So we&rsquo;re in force, it seems.... They say the other day Matthew Iványch Plátov drove them into the river Márina and drowned some eighteen thousand in one day.&rdquo;</p><p>Alpátych collected his parcels, handed them to the coachman who had come in, and settled up with the innkeeper. The noise of wheels, hoofs, and bells was heard from the gateway as a little trap passed out.</p><p>It was by now late in the afternoon. Half the street was in shadow, the other half brightly lit by the sun. Alpátych looked out of the window and went to the door.</p>",
  "page-390": "<p> Suddenly the strange sound of a far-off whistling and thud was heard, followed by a boom of cannon blending into a dull roar that set the windows rattling.</p><p>He went out into the street: two men were running past toward the bridge. From different sides came whistling sounds and the thud of cannon balls and bursting shells falling on the town. But these sounds were hardly heard in comparison with the noise of the firing outside the town and attracted little attention from the inhabitants. The town was being bombarded by a hundred and thirty guns which Napoleon had ordered up after four o&rsquo;clock. The people did not at once realize the meaning of this bombardment.</p>",
  "page-391": "<p>At first the noise of the falling bombs and shells only aroused curiosity. Ferapóntov&rsquo;s wife, who till then had not ceased wailing under the shed, became quiet and with the baby in her arms went to the gate, listening to the sounds and looking in silence at the people.</p><p>The cook and a shop assistant came to the gate. With lively curiosity everyone tried to get a glimpse of the projectiles as they flew over their heads. Several people came round the corner talking eagerly.</p><p>&ldquo;What force!&rdquo; remarked one. &ldquo;Knocked the roof and ceiling all to splinters!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Routed up the earth like a pig,&rdquo; said another.</p>",
  "page-392": "<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s grand, it bucks one up!&rdquo; laughed the first. &ldquo;Lucky you jumped aside, or it would have wiped you out!&rdquo;</p><p>Others joined those men and stopped and told how cannon balls had fallen on a house close to them. Meanwhile still more projectiles, now with the swift sinister whistle of a cannon ball, now with the agreeable intermittent whistle of a shell, flew over people&rsquo;s heads incessantly, but not one fell close by, they all flew over. Alpátych was getting into his trap. The innkeeper stood at the gate.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you staring at?&rdquo; he shouted to the cook, who in her red skirt, with sleeves rolled up, swinging her bare elbows, had stepped to the corner to listen to what was being said.</p>",
  "page-393": "<p>&ldquo;What marvels!&rdquo; she exclaimed, but hearing her master&rsquo;s voice she turned back, pulling down her tucked-up skirt.</p><p>Once more something whistled, but this time quite close, swooping downwards like a little bird; a flame flashed in the middle of the street, something exploded, and the street was shrouded in smoke.</p><p>&ldquo;Scoundrel, what are you doing?&rdquo; shouted the innkeeper, rushing to the cook.</p><p>At that moment the pitiful wailing of women was heard from different sides, the frightened baby began to cry, and people crowded silently with pale faces round the cook. The loudest sound in that crowd was her wailing.</p>",
  "page-394": "<p>&ldquo;Oh-h-h! Dear souls, dear kind souls! Don&rsquo;t let me die! My good souls!...&rdquo;</p><p>Five minutes later no one remained in the street. The cook, with her thigh broken by a shell splinter, had been carried into the kitchen. Alpátych, his coachman, Ferapóntov&rsquo;s wife and children and the house porter were all sitting in the cellar, listening. The roar of guns, the whistling of projectiles, and the piteous moaning of the cook, which rose above the other sounds, did not cease for a moment. The mistress rocked and hushed her baby and when anyone came into the cellar asked in a pathetic whisper what had become of her husband who had remained in the street. A shopman who entered told her that her husband had gone with others to the cathedral, whence they were fetching the wonder-working icon of Smolénsk.</p>",
  "page-395": "<p>Toward dusk the cannonade began to subside. Alpátych left the cellar and stopped in the doorway. The evening sky that had been so clear was clouded with smoke, through which, high up, the sickle of the new moon shone strangely. Now that the terrible din of the guns had ceased a hush seemed to reign over the town, broken only by the rustle of footsteps, the moaning, the distant cries, and the crackle of fires which seemed widespread everywhere. The cook&rsquo;s moans had now subsided. On two sides black curling clouds of smoke rose and spread from the fires. Through the streets soldiers in various uniforms walked or ran confusedly in different directions like ants from a ruined ant-hill. Several of them ran into Ferapóntov&rsquo;s yard before Alpátych&rsquo;s eyes. Alpátych went out to the gate. A retreating regiment, thronging and hurrying, blocked the street.</p>",
  "page-396": "<p>Noticing him, an officer said: &ldquo;The town is being abandoned. Get away, get away!&rdquo; and then, turning to the soldiers, shouted:</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you to run into the yards!&rdquo;</p><p>Alpátych went back to the house, called the coachman, and told him to set off. Ferapóntov&rsquo;s whole household came out too, following Alpátych and the coachman. The women, who had been silent till then, suddenly began to wail as they looked at the fires&mdash;the smoke and even the flames of which could be seen in the failing twilight&mdash;and as if in reply the same kind of lamentation was heard from other parts of the street. Inside the shed Alpátych and the coachman arranged the tangled reins and traces of their horses with trembling hands.</p>",
  "page-397": "<p>As Alpátych was driving out of the gate he saw some ten soldiers in Ferapóntov&rsquo;s open shop, talking loudly and filling their bags and knapsacks with flour and sunflower seeds. Just then Ferapóntov returned and entered his shop. On seeing the soldiers he was about to shout at them, but suddenly stopped and, clutching at his hair, burst into sobs and laughter:</p><p>&ldquo;Loot everything, lads! Don&rsquo;t let those devils get it!&rdquo; he cried, taking some bags of flour himself and throwing them into the street.</p><p>Some of the soldiers were frightened and ran away, others went on filling their bags. On seeing Alpátych, Ferapóntov turned to him:</p>",
  "page-398": "<p>&ldquo;Russia is done for!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Alpátych, I&rsquo;ll set the place on fire myself. We&rsquo;re done for!...&rdquo; and Ferapóntov ran into the yard.</p><p>Soldiers were passing in a constant stream along the street blocking it completely, so that Alpátych could not pass out and had to wait. Ferapóntov&rsquo;s wife and children were also sitting in a cart waiting till it was possible to drive out.</p><p>Night had come. There were stars in the sky and the new moon shone out amid the smoke that screened it. On the sloping descent to the Dnieper Alpátych&rsquo;s cart and that of the innkeeper&rsquo;s wife, which were slowly moving amid the rows of soldiers and of other vehicles, had to stop. In a side street near the crossroads where the vehicles had stopped, a house and some shops were on fire. This fire was already burning itself out.</p>",
  "page-399": "<p> The flames now died down and were lost in the black smoke, now suddenly flared up again brightly, lighting up with strange distinctness the faces of the people crowding at the crossroads. Black figures flitted about before the fire, and through the incessant crackling of the flames talking and shouting could be heard. Seeing that his trap would not be able to move on for some time, Alpátych got down and turned into the side street to look at the fire. Soldiers were continually rushing backwards and forwards near it, and he saw two of them and a man in a frieze coat dragging burning beams into another yard across the street, while others carried bundles of hay.</p><p>Alpátych went up to a large crowd standing before a high barn which was blazing briskly. The walls were all on fire and the back wall had fallen in, the wooden roof was collapsing, and the rafters were alight. The crowd was evidently watching for the roof to fall in, and Alpátych watched for it too.</p>",
  "page-400": "<p>&ldquo;Alpátych!&rdquo; a familiar voice suddenly hailed the old man.</p><p>&ldquo;Mercy on us! Your excellency!&rdquo; answered Alpátych, immediately recognizing the voice of his young prince.</p><p>Prince Andrew in his riding cloak, mounted on a black horse, was looking at Alpátych from the back of the crowd.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Your... your excellency,&rdquo; stammered Alpátych and broke into sobs. &ldquo;Are we really lost? Master!...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo; Prince Andrew repeated.</p>",
  "page-401": "<p>At that moment the flames flared up and showed his young master&rsquo;s pale worn face. Alpátych told how he had been sent there and how difficult it was to get away.</p><p>&ldquo;Are we really quite lost, your excellency?&rdquo; he asked again.</p><p>Prince Andrew without replying took out a notebook and raising his knee began writing in pencil on a page he tore out. He wrote to his sister:</p><p>&ldquo;Smolénsk is being abandoned. Bald Hills will be occupied by the enemy within a week. Set off immediately for Moscow. Let me know at once when you will start. Send by special messenger to Usvyázh.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-402": "<p>Having written this and given the paper to Alpátych, he told him how to arrange for departure of the prince, the princess, his son, and the boy&rsquo;s tutor, and how and where to let him know immediately. Before he had had time to finish giving these instructions, a chief of staff followed by a suite galloped up to him.</p><p>&ldquo;You are a colonel?&rdquo; shouted the chief of staff with a German accent, in a voice familiar to Prince Andrew. &ldquo;Houses are set on fire in your presence and you stand by! What does this mean? You will answer for it!&rdquo; shouted Berg, who was now assistant to the chief of staff of the commander of the left flank of the infantry of the first army, a place, as Berg said, &ldquo;very agreeable and well en évidence.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-403": "<p>Prince Andrew looked at him and without replying went on speaking to Alpátych.</p><p>&ldquo;So tell them that I shall await a reply till the tenth, and if by the tenth I don&rsquo;t receive news that they have all got away I shall have to throw up everything and come myself to Bald Hills.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; said Berg, recognizing Prince Andrew, &ldquo;I only spoke because I have to obey orders, because I always do obey exactly.... You must please excuse me,&rdquo; he went on apologetically.</p><p>Something cracked in the flames. The fire died down for a moment and wreaths of black smoke rolled from under the roof. There was another terrible crash and something huge collapsed.</p>",
  "page-404": "<p>&ldquo;Ou-rou-rou!&rdquo; yelled the crowd, echoing the crash of the collapsing roof of the barn, the burning grain in which diffused a cakelike aroma all around. The flames flared up again, lighting the animated, delighted, exhausted faces of the spectators.</p><p>The man in the frieze coat raised his arms and shouted:</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, lads! Now it&rsquo;s raging... It&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the owner himself,&rdquo; cried several voices.</p><p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; continued Prince Andrew to Alpátych, &ldquo;report to them as I have told you&rdquo;; and not replying a word to Berg who was now mute beside him, he touched his horse and rode down the side street.</p>",
  "page-405": "<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>",
  "page-406": "<p>From Smolénsk the troops continued to retreat, followed by the enemy. On the tenth of August the regiment Prince Andrew commanded was marching along the highroad past the avenue leading to Bald Hills. Heat and drought had continued for more than three weeks. Each day fleecy clouds floated across the sky and occasionally veiled the sun, but toward evening the sky cleared again and the sun set in reddish-brown mist. Heavy night dews alone refreshed the earth. The unreaped corn was scorched and shed its grain. The marshes dried up. The cattle lowed from hunger, finding no food on the sun-parched meadows. Only at night and in the forests while the dew lasted was there any freshness. But on the road, the highroad along which the troops marched, there was no such freshness even at night or when the road passed through the forest; the dew was imperceptible on the sandy dust churned up more than six inches deep.</p>",
  "page-407": "<p> As soon as day dawned the march began. The artillery and baggage wagons moved noiselessly through the deep dust that rose to the very hubs of the wheels, and the infantry sank ankle-deep in that soft, choking, hot dust that never cooled even at night. Some of this dust was kneaded by the feet and wheels, while the rest rose and hung like a cloud over the troops, settling in eyes, ears, hair, and nostrils, and worst of all in the lungs of the men and beasts as they moved along that road. The higher the sun rose the higher rose that cloud of dust, and through the screen of its hot fine particles one could look with naked eye at the sun, which showed like a huge crimson ball in the unclouded sky. There was no wind, and the men choked in that motionless atmosphere. They marched with handkerchiefs tied over their noses and mouths.</p>",
  "page-408": "<p> When they passed through a village they all rushed to the wells and fought for the water and drank it down to the mud.</p><p>Prince Andrew was in command of a regiment, and the management of that regiment, the welfare of the men and the necessity of receiving and giving orders, engrossed him. The burning of Smolénsk and its abandonment made an epoch in his life. A novel feeling of anger against the foe made him forget his own sorrow. He was entirely devoted to the affairs of his regiment and was considerate and kind to his men and officers. In the regiment they called him &ldquo;our prince,&rdquo; were proud of him and loved him. But he was kind and gentle only to those of his regiment, to Timókhin and the like&mdash;people quite new to him, belonging to a different world and who could not know and understand his past.</p>",
  "page-409": "<p> As soon as he came across a former acquaintance or anyone from the staff, he bristled up immediately and grew spiteful, ironical, and contemptuous. Everything that reminded him of his past was repugnant to him, and so in his relations with that former circle he confined himself to trying to do his duty and not to be unfair.</p><p>In truth everything presented itself in a dark and gloomy light to Prince Andrew, especially after the abandonment of Smolénsk on the sixth of August (he considered that it could and should have been defended) and after his sick father had had to flee to Moscow, abandoning to pillage his dearly beloved Bald Hills which he had built and peopled. But despite this, thanks to his regiment, Prince Andrew had something to think about entirely apart from general questions.</p>",
  "page-410": "<p> Two days previously he had received news that his father, son, and sister had left for Moscow; and though there was nothing for him to do at Bald Hills, Prince Andrew with a characteristic desire to foment his own grief decided that he must ride there.</p><p>He ordered his horse to be saddled and, leaving his regiment on the march, rode to his father&rsquo;s estate where he had been born and spent his childhood. Riding past the pond where there used always to be dozens of women chattering as they rinsed their linen or beat it with wooden beetles, Prince Andrew noticed that there was not a soul about and that the little washing wharf, torn from its place and half submerged, was floating on its side in the middle of the pond. He rode to the keeper&rsquo;s lodge. No one at the stone entrance gates of the drive and the door stood open.</p>",
  "page-411": "<p> Grass had already begun to grow on the garden paths, and horses and calves were straying in the English park. Prince Andrew rode up to the hothouse; some of the glass panes were broken, and of the trees in tubs some were overturned and others dried up. He called for Tarás the gardener, but no one replied. Having gone round the corner of the hothouse to the ornamental garden, he saw that the carved garden fence was broken and branches of the plum trees had been torn off with the fruit. An old peasant whom Prince Andrew in his childhood had often seen at the gate was sitting on a green garden seat, plaiting a bast shoe.</p><p>He was deaf and did not hear Prince Andrew ride up. He was sitting on the seat the old prince used to like to sit on, and beside him strips of bast were hanging on the broken and withered branch of a magnolia.</p>",
  "page-412": "<p>Prince Andrew rode up to the house. Several limes in the old garden had been cut down and a piebald mare and her foal were wandering in front of the house among the rosebushes. The shutters were all closed, except at one window which was open. A little serf boy, seeing Prince Andrew, ran into the house. Alpátych, having sent his family away, was alone at Bald Hills and was sitting indoors reading the Lives of the Saints. On hearing that Prince Andrew had come, he went out with his spectacles on his nose, buttoning his coat, and, hastily stepping up, without a word began weeping and kissing Prince Andrew&rsquo;s knee.</p><p>Then, vexed at his own weakness, he turned away and began to report on the position of affairs. Everything precious and valuable had been removed to Boguchárovo. Seventy quarters of grain had also been carted away.</p>",
  "page-413": "<p> The hay and the spring corn, of which Alpátych said there had been a remarkable crop that year, had been commandeered by the troops and mown down while still green. The peasants were ruined; some of them too had gone to Boguchárovo, only a few remained.</p><p>Without waiting to hear him out, Prince Andrew asked:</p><p>&ldquo;When did my father and sister leave?&rdquo; meaning when did they leave for Moscow.</p><p>Alpátych, understanding the question to refer to their departure for Boguchárovo, replied that they had left on the seventh and again went into details concerning the estate management, asking for instructions.</p>",
  "page-414": "<p>&ldquo;Am I to let the troops have the oats, and to take a receipt for them? We have still six hundred quarters left,&rdquo; he inquired.</p><p>&ldquo;What am I to say to him?&rdquo; thought Prince Andrew, looking down on the old man&rsquo;s bald head shining in the sun and seeing by the expression on his face that the old man himself understood how untimely such questions were and only asked them to allay his grief.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, let them have it,&rdquo; replied Prince Andrew.</p><p>&ldquo;If you noticed some disorder in the garden,&rdquo; said Alpátych, &ldquo;it was impossible to prevent it. Three regiments have been here and spent the night, dragoons mostly. I took down the name and rank of their commanding officer, to hand in a complaint about it.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-415": "<p>&ldquo;Well, and what are you going to do? Will you stay here if the enemy occupies the place?&rdquo; asked Prince Andrew.</p><p>Alpátych turned his face to Prince Andrew, looked at him, and suddenly with a solemn gesture raised his arm.</p><p>&ldquo;He is my refuge! His will be done!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p><p>A group of bareheaded peasants was approaching across the meadow toward the prince.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, good-by!&rdquo; said Prince Andrew, bending over to Alpátych. &ldquo;You must go away too, take away what you can and tell the serfs to go to the Ryazán estate or to the one near Moscow.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-416": "<p>Alpátych clung to Prince Andrew&rsquo;s leg and burst into sobs. Gently disengaging himself, the prince spurred his horse and rode down the avenue at a gallop.</p><p>The old man was still sitting in the ornamental garden, like a fly impassive on the face of a loved one who is dead, tapping the last on which he was making the bast shoe, and two little girls, running out from the hot house carrying in their skirts plums they had plucked from the trees there, came upon Prince Andrew. On seeing the young master, the elder one with frightened look clutched her younger companion by the hand and hid with her behind a birch tree, not stopping to pick up some green plums they had dropped.</p>",
  "page-417": "<p>Prince Andrew turned away with startled haste, unwilling to let them see that they had been observed. He was sorry for the pretty frightened little girl, was afraid of looking at her, and yet felt an irresistible desire to do so. A new sensation of comfort and relief came over him when, seeing these girls, he realized the existence of other human interests entirely aloof from his own and just as legitimate as those that occupied him. Evidently these girls passionately desired one thing&mdash;to carry away and eat those green plums without being caught&mdash;and Prince Andrew shared their wish for the success of their enterprise. He could not resist looking at them once more. Believing their danger past, they sprang from their ambush and, chirruping something in their shrill little voices and holding up their skirts, their bare little sunburned feet scampered merrily and quickly across the meadow grass.</p>",
  "page-418": "<p>Prince Andrew was somewhat refreshed by having ridden off the dusty highroad along which the troops were moving. But not far from Bald Hills he again came out on the road and overtook his regiment at its halting place by the dam of a small pond. It was past one o&rsquo;clock. The sun, a red ball through the dust, burned and scorched his back intolerably through his black coat. The dust always hung motionless above the buzz of talk that came from the resting troops. There was no wind. As he crossed the dam Prince Andrew smelled the ooze and freshness of the pond. He longed to get into that water, however dirty it might be, and he glanced round at the pool from whence came sounds of shrieks and laughter. The small, muddy, green pond had risen visibly more than a foot, flooding the dam, because it was full of the naked white bodies of soldiers with brick-red hands, necks, and faces, who were splashing about in it.</p>",
  "page-419": "<p> All this naked white human flesh, laughing and shrieking, floundered about in that dirty pool like carp stuffed into a watering can, and the suggestion of merriment in that floundering mass rendered it specially pathetic.</p><p>One fair-haired young soldier of the third company, whom Prince Andrew knew and who had a strap round the calf of one leg, crossed himself, stepped back to get a good run, and plunged into the water; another, a dark noncommissioned officer who was always shaggy, stood up to his waist in the water joyfully wriggling his muscular figure and snorted with satisfaction as he poured the water over his head with hands blackened to the wrists. There were sounds of men slapping one another, yelling, and puffing.</p>",
  "page-420": "<p>Everywhere on the bank, on the dam, and in the pond, there was healthy, white, muscular flesh. The officer, Timókhin, with his red little nose, standing on the dam wiping himself with a towel, felt confused at seeing the prince, but made up his mind to address him nevertheless.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very nice, your excellency! Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to?&rdquo; said he.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dirty,&rdquo; replied Prince Andrew, making a grimace.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll clear it out for you in a minute,&rdquo; said Timókhin, and, still undressed, ran off to clear the men out of the pond.</p>",
  "page-421": "<p>&ldquo;The prince wants to bathe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What prince? Ours?&rdquo; said many voices, and the men were in such haste to clear out that the prince could hardly stop them. He decided that he would rather wash himself with water in the barn.</p><p>&ldquo;Flesh, bodies, cannon fodder!&rdquo; he thought, and he looked at his own naked body and shuddered, not from cold but from a sense of disgust and horror he did not himself understand, aroused by the sight of that immense number of bodies splashing about in the dirty pond.</p><p>On the seventh of August Prince Bagratión wrote as follows from his quarters at Mikháylovna on the Smolénsk road:</p>",
  "page-422": "<p>Dear Count Aléxis Andréevich&mdash;(He was writing to Arakchéev but knew that his letter would be read by the Emperor, and therefore weighed every word in it to the best of his ability.)</p><p>I expect the Minister (Barclay de Tolly) has already reported the abandonment of Smolénsk to the enemy. It is pitiable and sad, and the whole army is in despair that this most important place has been wantonly abandoned. I, for my part, begged him personally most urgently and finally wrote him, but nothing would induce him to consent. I swear to you on my honor that Napoleon was in such a fix as never before and might have lost half his army but could not have taken Smolénsk. Our troops fought, and are fighting, as never before. With fifteen thousand men I held the enemy at bay for thirty-five hours and beat him; but he would not hold out even for fourteen hours.</p>",
  "page-423": "<p> It is disgraceful, a stain on our army, and as for him, he ought, it seems to me, not to live. If he reports that our losses were great, it is not true; perhaps about four thousand, not more, and not even that; but even were they ten thousand, that&rsquo;s war! But the enemy has lost masses....</p><p>What would it have cost him to hold out for another two days? They would have had to retire of their own accord, for they had no water for men or horses. He gave me his word he would not retreat, but suddenly sent instructions that he was retiring that night. We cannot fight in this way, or we may soon bring the enemy to Moscow....</p>",
  "page-424": "<p>There is a rumor that you are thinking of peace. God forbid that you should make peace after all our sacrifices and such insane retreats! You would set all Russia against you and everyone of us would feel ashamed to wear the uniform. If it has come to this&mdash;we must fight as long as Russia can and as long as there are men able to stand....</p><p>One man ought to be in command, and not two. Your Minister may perhaps be good as a Minister, but as a general he is not merely bad but execrable, yet to him is entrusted the fate of our whole country.... I am really frantic with vexation; forgive my writing boldly. It is clear that the man who advocates the conclusion of a peace, and that the Minister should command the army, does not love our sovereign and desires the ruin of us all. So I write you frankly: call out the militia.</p>",
  "page-425": "<p> For the Minister is leading these visitors after him to Moscow in a most masterly way. The whole army feels great suspicion of the Imperial aide-de-camp Wolzogen. He is said to be more Napoleon&rsquo;s man than ours, and he is always advising the Minister. I am not merely civil to him but obey him like a corporal, though I am his senior. This is painful, but, loving my benefactor and sovereign, I submit. Only I am sorry for the Emperor that he entrusts our fine army to such as he. Consider that on our retreat we have lost by fatigue and left in the hospital more than fifteen thousand men, and had we attacked this would not have happened. Tell me, for God&rsquo;s sake, what will Russia, our mother Russia, say to our being so frightened, and why are we abandoning our good and gallant Fatherland to such rabble and implanting feelings of hatred and shame in all our subjects?</p>",
  "page-426": "<p> What are we scared at and of whom are we afraid? I am not to blame that the Minister is vacillating, a coward, dense, dilatory, and has all bad qualities. The whole army bewails it and calls down curses upon him....</p>",
  "page-427": "<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>",
  "page-428": "<p>Among the innumerable categories applicable to the phenomena of human life one may discriminate between those in which substance prevails and those in which form prevails. To the latter&mdash;as distinguished from village, country, provincial, or even Moscow life&mdash;we may allot Petersburg life, and especially the life of its salons. That life of the salons is unchanging. Since the year 1805 we had made peace and had again quarreled with Bonaparte and had made constitutions and unmade them again, but the salons of Anna Pávlovna and Hélène remained just as they had been&mdash;the one seven and the other five years before. At Anna Pávlovna&rsquo;s they talked with perplexity of Bonaparte&rsquo;s successes just as before and saw in them and in the subservience shown to him by the European sovereigns a malicious conspiracy, the sole object of which was to cause unpleasantness and anxiety to the court circle of which Anna Pávlovna was the representative.</p>",
  "page-429": "<p> And in Hélène&rsquo;s salon, which Rumyántsev himself honored with his visits, regarding Hélène as a remarkably intelligent woman, they talked with the same ecstasy in 1812 as in 1808 of the &ldquo;great nation&rdquo; and the &ldquo;great man,&rdquo; and regretted our rupture with France, a rupture which, according to them, ought to be promptly terminated by peace.</p><p>Of late, since the Emperor&rsquo;s return from the army, there had been some excitement in these conflicting salon circles and some demonstrations of hostility to one another, but each camp retained its own tendency. In Anna Pávlovna&rsquo;s circle only those Frenchmen were admitted who were deep-rooted legitimists, and patriotic views were expressed to the effect that one ought not to go to the French theater and that to maintain the French troupe was costing the government as much as a whole army corps.</p>",
  "page-430": "<p> The progress of the war was eagerly followed, and only the reports most flattering to our army were circulated. In the French circle of Hélène and Rumyántsev the reports of the cruelty of the enemy and of the war were contradicted and all Napoleon&rsquo;s attempts at conciliation were discussed. In that circle they discountenanced those who advised hurried preparations for a removal to Kazán of the court and the girls&rsquo; educational establishments under the patronage of the Dowager Empress. In Hélène&rsquo;s circle the war in general was regarded as a series of formal demonstrations which would very soon end in peace, and the view prevailed expressed by Bilíbin&mdash;who now in Petersburg was quite at home in Hélène&rsquo;s house, which every clever man was obliged to visit&mdash;that not by gunpowder but by those who invented it would matters be settled.</p>",
  "page-431": "<p> In that circle the Moscow enthusiasm&mdash;news of which had reached Petersburg simultaneously with the Emperor&rsquo;s return&mdash;was ridiculed sarcastically and very cleverly, though with much caution.</p><p>Anna Pávlovna&rsquo;s circle on the contrary was enraptured by this enthusiasm and spoke of it as Plutarch speaks of the deeds of the ancients. Prince Vasíli, who still occupied his former important posts, formed a connecting link between these two circles. He visited his &ldquo;good friend Anna Pávlovna&rdquo; as well as his daughter&rsquo;s &ldquo;diplomatic salon,&rdquo; and often in his constant comings and goings between the two camps became confused and said at Hélène&rsquo;s what he should have said at Anna Pávlovna&rsquo;s and vice versa.</p>",
  "page-432": "<p>Soon after the Emperor&rsquo;s return Prince Vasíli in a conversation about the war at Anna Pávlovna&rsquo;s severely condemned Barclay de Tolly, but was undecided as to who ought to be appointed commander in chief. One of the visitors, usually spoken of as &ldquo;a man of great merit,&rdquo; having described how he had that day seen Kutúzov, the newly chosen chief of the Petersburg militia, presiding over the enrollment of recruits at the Treasury, cautiously ventured to suggest that Kutúzov would be the man to satisfy all requirements.</p><p>Anna Pávlovna remarked with a melancholy smile that Kutúzov had done nothing but cause the Emperor annoyance.</p>",
  "page-433": "<p>&ldquo;I have talked and talked at the Assembly of the Nobility,&rdquo; Prince Vasíli interrupted, &ldquo;but they did not listen to me. I told them his election as chief of the militia would not please the Emperor. They did not listen to me.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all this mania for opposition,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;And who for? It is all because we want to ape the foolish enthusiasm of those Muscovites,&rdquo; Prince Vasíli continued, forgetting for a moment that though at Hélène&rsquo;s one had to ridicule the Moscow enthusiasm, at Anna Pávlovna&rsquo;s one had to be ecstatic about it. But he retrieved his mistake at once. &ldquo;Now, is it suitable that Count Kutúzov, the oldest general in Russia, should preside at that tribunal? He will get nothing for his pains!</p>",
  "page-434": "<p> How could they make a man commander in chief who cannot mount a horse, who drops asleep at a council, and has the very worst morals! A good reputation he made for himself at Bucharest! I don&rsquo;t speak of his capacity as a general, but at a time like this how they appoint a decrepit, blind old man, positively blind? A fine idea to have a blind general! He can&rsquo;t see anything. To play blindman&rsquo;s bluff? He can&rsquo;t see at all!&rdquo;</p><p>No one replied to his remarks.</p><p>This was quite correct on the twenty-fourth of July. But on the twenty-ninth of July Kutúzov received the title of Prince. This might indicate a wish to get rid of him, and therefore Prince Vasíli&rsquo;s opinion continued to be correct though he was not now in any hurry to express it.</p>",
  "page-435": "<p> But on the eighth of August a committee, consisting of Field Marshal Saltykóv, Arakchéev, Vyazmítinov, Lopukhín, and Kochubéy met to consider the progress of the war. This committee came to the conclusion that our failures were due to a want of unity in the command and though the members of the committee were aware of the Emperor&rsquo;s dislike of Kutúzov, after a short deliberation they agreed to advise his appointment as commander in chief. That same day Kutúzov was appointed commander in chief with full powers over the armies and over the whole region occupied by them.</p><p>On the ninth of August Prince Vasíli at Anna Pávlovna&rsquo;s again met the &ldquo;man of great merit.&rdquo; The latter was very attentive to Anna Pávlovna because he wanted to be appointed director of one of the educational establishments for young ladies.</p>",
  "page-436": "<p> Prince Vasíli entered the room with the air of a happy conqueror who has attained the object of his desires.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, have you heard the great news? Prince Kutúzov is field marshal! All dissensions are at an end! I am so glad, so delighted! At last we have a man!&rdquo; said he, glancing sternly and significantly round at everyone in the drawing room.</p><p>The &ldquo;man of great merit,&rdquo; despite his desire to obtain the post of director, could not refrain from reminding Prince Vasíli of his former opinion. Though this was impolite to Prince Vasíli in Anna Pávlovna&rsquo;s drawing room, and also to Anna Pávlovna herself who had received the news with delight, he could not resist the temptation.</p>",
  "page-437": "<p>&ldquo;But, Prince, they say he is blind!&rdquo; said he, reminding Prince Vasíli of his own words.</p><p>&ldquo;Eh? Nonsense! He sees well enough,&rdquo; said Prince Vasíli rapidly, in a deep voice and with a slight cough&mdash;the voice and cough with which he was wont to dispose of all difficulties.</p><p>&ldquo;He sees well enough,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;And what I am so pleased about,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;is that our sovereign has given him full powers over all the armies and the whole region&mdash;powers no commander in chief ever had before. He is a second autocrat,&rdquo; he concluded with a victorious smile.</p>",
  "page-438": "<p>&ldquo;God grant it! God grant it!&rdquo; said Anna Pávlovna.</p><p>The &ldquo;man of great merit,&rdquo; who was still a novice in court circles, wishing to flatter Anna Pávlovna by defending her former position on this question, observed:</p><p>&ldquo;It is said that the Emperor was reluctant to give Kutúzov those powers. They say he blushed like a girl to whom Joconde is read, when he said to Kutúzov: &lsquo;Your Emperor and the Fatherland award you this honor.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps the heart took no part in that speech,&rdquo; said Anna Pávlovna.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no!&rdquo; warmly rejoined Prince Vasíli, who would not now yield Kutúzov to anyone; in his opinion Kutúzov was not only admirable himself, but was adored by everybody. &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for our sovereign appreciated him so highly before.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-439": "<p>&ldquo;God grant only that Prince Kutúzov assumes real power and does not allow anyone to put a spoke in his wheel,&rdquo; observed Anna Pávlovna.</p><p>Understanding at once to whom she alluded, Prince Vasíli said in a whisper:</p><p>&ldquo;I know for a fact that Kutúzov made it an absolute condition that the Tsarévich should not be with the army. Do you know what he said to the Emperor?&rdquo;</p><p>And Prince Vasíli repeated the words supposed to have been spoken by Kutúzov to the Emperor. &ldquo;I can neither punish him if he does wrong nor reward him if he does right.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-440": "<p>&ldquo;Oh, a very wise man is Prince Kutúzov! I have known him a long time!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They even say,&rdquo; remarked the &ldquo;man of great merit&rdquo; who did not yet possess courtly tact, &ldquo;that his excellency made it an express condition that the sovereign himself should not be with the army.&rdquo;</p><p>As soon as he said this both Prince Vasíli and Anna Pávlovna turned away from him and glanced sadly at one another with a sigh at his naïveté.</p>",

  "page-442": "<p>While this was taking place in Petersburg the French had already passed Smolénsk and were drawing nearer and nearer to Moscow. Napoleon&rsquo;s historian Thiers, like other of his historians, trying to justify his hero says that he was drawn to the walls of Moscow against his will. He is as right as other historians who look for the explanation of historic events in the will of one man; he is as right as the Russian historians who maintain that Napoleon was drawn to Moscow by the skill of the Russian commanders. Here besides the law of retrospection, which regards all the past as a preparation for events that subsequently occur, the law of reciprocity comes in, confusing the whole matter. A good chessplayer having lost a game is sincerely convinced that his loss resulted from a mistake he made and looks for that mistake in the opening, but forgets that at each stage of the game there were similar mistakes and that none of his moves were perfect.</p>",
  "page-443": "<p> He only notices the mistake to which he pays attention, because his opponent took advantage of it. How much more complex than this is the game of war, which occurs under certain limits of time, and where it is not one will that manipulates lifeless objects, but everything results from innumerable conflicts of various wills!</p><p>After Smolénsk Napoleon sought a battle beyond Dorogobúzh at Vyázma, and then at Tsárevo-Zaymíshche, but it happened that owing to a conjunction of innumerable circumstances the Russians could not give battle till they reached Borodinó, seventy miles from Moscow. From Vyázma Napoleon ordered a direct advance on Moscow.</p><p>Moscou, la capitale asiatique de ce grand empire, la ville sacrée des peuples d&rsquo;Alexandre, Moscou avec ses innombrables églises en forme de pagodes chinoises, * this Moscow gave Napoleon&rsquo;s imagination no rest.</p>",
  "page-444": "<p> On the march from Vyázma to Tsárevo-Zaymíshche he rode his light bay bobtailed ambler accompanied by his Guards, his bodyguard, his pages, and aides-de-camp. Berthier, his chief of staff, dropped behind to question a Russian prisoner captured by the cavalry. Followed by Lelorgne d&rsquo;Ideville, an interpreter, he overtook Napoleon at a gallop and reined in his horse with an amused expression.</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Napoleon.</p><p>&ldquo;One of Plátov&rsquo;s Cossacks says that Plátov&rsquo;s corps is joining up with the main army and that Kutúzov has been appointed commander in chief. He is a very shrewd and garrulous fellow.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-445": "<p>Napoleon smiled and told them to give the Cossack a horse and bring the man to him. He wished to talk to him himself. Several adjutants galloped off, and an hour later, Lavrúshka, the serf Denísov had handed over to Rostóv, rode up to Napoleon in an orderly&rsquo;s jacket and on a French cavalry saddle, with a merry, and tipsy face. Napoleon told him to ride by his side and began questioning him.</p><p>&ldquo;You are a Cossack?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, a Cossack, your Honor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Cossack, not knowing in what company he was, for Napoleon&rsquo;s plain appearance had nothing about it that would reveal to an Oriental mind the presence of a monarch, talked with extreme familiarity of the incidents of the war,&rdquo; says Thiers, narrating this episode.</p>",
  "page-446": "<p> In reality Lavrúshka, having got drunk the day before and left his master dinnerless, had been whipped and sent to the village in quest of chickens, where he engaged in looting till the French took him prisoner. Lavrúshka was one of those coarse, bare-faced lackeys who have seen all sorts of things, consider it necessary to do everything in a mean and cunning way, are ready to render any sort of service to their master, and are keen at guessing their master&rsquo;s baser impulses, especially those prompted by vanity and pettiness.</p><p>Finding himself in the company of Napoleon, whose identity he had easily and surely recognized, Lavrúshka was not in the least abashed but merely did his utmost to gain his new master&rsquo;s favor.</p>",
  "page-447": "<p>He knew very well that this was Napoleon, but Napoleon&rsquo;s presence could no more intimidate him than Rostóv&rsquo;s, or a sergeant major&rsquo;s with the rods, would have done, for he had nothing that either the sergeant major or Napoleon could deprive him of.</p><p>So he rattled on, telling all the gossip he had heard among the orderlies. Much of it true. But when Napoleon asked him whether the Russians thought they would beat Bonaparte or not, Lavrúshka screwed up his eyes and considered.</p><p>In this question he saw subtle cunning, as men of his type see cunning in everything, so he frowned and did not answer immediately.</p>",
  "page-448": "<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully, &ldquo;if there&rsquo;s a battle soon, yours will win. That&rsquo;s right. But if three days pass, then after that, well, then that same battle will not soon be over.&rdquo;</p><p>Lelorgne d&rsquo;Ideville smilingly interpreted this speech to Napoleon thus: &ldquo;If a battle takes place within the next three days the French will win, but if later, God knows what will happen.&rdquo; Napoleon did not smile, though he was evidently in high good humor, and he ordered these words to be repeated.</p><p>Lavrúshka noticed this and to entertain him further, pretending not to know who Napoleon was, added:</p>",
  "page-449": "<p>&ldquo;We know that you have Bonaparte and that he has beaten everybody in the world, but we are a different matter...&rdquo;&mdash;without knowing why or how this bit of boastful patriotism slipped out at the end.</p><p>The interpreter translated these words without the last phrase, and Bonaparte smiled. &ldquo;The young Cossack made his mighty interlocutor smile,&rdquo; says Thiers. After riding a few paces in silence, Napoleon turned to Berthier and said he wished to see how the news that he was talking to the Emperor himself, to that very Emperor who had written his immortally victorious name on the Pyramids, would affect this enfant du Don. *</p><p>The fact was accordingly conveyed to Lavrúshka.</p>",
  "page-450": "<p>Lavrúshka, understanding that this was done to perplex him and that Napoleon expected him to be frightened, to gratify his new masters promptly pretended to be astonished and awe-struck, opened his eyes wide, and assumed the expression he usually put on when taken to be whipped. &ldquo;As soon as Napoleon&rsquo;s interpreter had spoken,&rdquo; says Thiers, &ldquo;the Cossack, seized by amazement, did not utter another word, but rode on, his eyes fixed on the conqueror whose fame had reached him across the steppes of the East. All his loquacity was suddenly arrested and replaced by a naïve and silent feeling of admiration. Napoleon, after making the Cossack a present, had him set free like a bird restored to its native fields.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-451": "<p>Napoleon rode on, dreaming of the Moscow that so appealed to his imagination, and &ldquo;the bird restored to its native fields&rdquo; galloped to our outposts, inventing on the way all that had not taken place but that he meant to relate to his comrades. What had really taken place he did not wish to relate because it seemed to him not worth telling. He found the Cossacks, inquired for the regiment operating with Plátov&rsquo;s detachment and by evening found his master, Nicholas Rostóv, quartered at Yankóvo. Rostóv was just mounting to go for a ride round the neighboring villages with Ilyín; he let Lavrúshka have another horse and took him along with him.</p>",

Princess Mary, alarmed by her father&rsquo;s feverish and sleepless activity after his previous apathy, could not bring herself to leave him alone and for the first time in her life ventured to disobey him. She refused to go away and her father&rsquo;s fury broke over her in a terrible storm. He repeated every injustice he had ever inflicted on her. Trying to convict her, he told her she had worn him out, had caused his quarrel with his son, had harbored nasty suspicions of him, making it the object of her life to poison his existence, and he drove her from his study telling her that if she did not go away it was all the same to him. He declared that he did not wish to remember her existence and warned her not to dare to let him see her.</p>",
  "page-455": "<p> The fact that he did not, as she had feared, order her to be carried away by force but only told her not to let him see her cheered Princess Mary. She knew it was a proof that in the depth of his soul he was glad she was remaining at home and had not gone away.</p><p>The morning after little Nicholas had left, the old prince donned his full uniform and prepared to visit the commander in chief. His calèche was already at the door. Princess Mary saw him walk out of the house in his uniform wearing all his orders and go down the garden to review his armed peasants and domestic serfs. She sat by the window listening to his voice which reached her from the garden. Suddenly several men came running up the avenue with frightened faces.</p>",
  "page-456": "<p>Princess Mary ran out to the porch, down the flower-bordered path, and into the avenue. A large crowd of militiamen and domestics were moving toward her, and in their midst several men were supporting by the armpits and dragging along a little old man in a uniform and decorations. She ran up to him and, in the play of the sunlight that fell in small round spots through the shade of the lime-tree avenue, could not be sure what change there was in his face. All she could see was that his former stern and determined expression had altered to one of timidity and submission. On seeing his daughter he moved his helpless lips and made a hoarse sound. It was impossible to make out what he wanted. He was lifted up, carried to his study, and laid on the very couch he had so feared of late.</p>",
  "page-457": "<p>The doctor, who was fetched that same night, bled him and said that the prince had had a seizure paralyzing his right side.</p><p>It was becoming more and more dangerous to remain at Bald Hills, and next day they moved the prince to Boguchárovo, the doctor accompanying him.</p><p>By the time they reached Boguchárovo, Dessalles and the little prince had already left for Moscow.</p><p>For three weeks the old prince lay stricken by paralysis in the new house Prince Andrew had built at Boguchárovo, ever in the same state, getting neither better nor worse. He was unconscious and lay like a distorted corpse. He muttered unceasingly, his eyebrows and lips twitching, and it was impossible to tell whether he understood what was going on around him or not. One thing was certain&mdash;that he was suffering and wished to say something.</p>",
  "page-458": "<p> But what it was, no one could tell: it might be some caprice of a sick and half-crazy man, or it might relate to public affairs, or possibly to family concerns.</p><p>The doctor said this restlessness did not mean anything and was due to physical causes; but Princess Mary thought he wished to tell her something, and the fact that her presence always increased his restlessness confirmed her opinion.</p><p>He was evidently suffering both physically and mentally. There was no hope of recovery. It was impossible for him to travel, it would not do to let him die on the road. &ldquo;Would it not be better if the end did come, the very end?&rdquo; Princess Mary sometimes thought. Night and day, hardly sleeping at all, she watched him and, terrible to say, often watched him not with hope of finding signs of improvement but wishing to find symptoms of the approach of the end.</p>",
  "page-459": "<p>Strange as it was to her to acknowledge this feeling in herself, yet there it was. And what seemed still more terrible to her was that since her father&rsquo;s illness began (perhaps even sooner, when she stayed with him expecting something to happen), all the personal desires and hopes that had been forgotten or sleeping within her had awakened. Thoughts that had not entered her mind for years&mdash;thoughts of a life free from the fear of her father, and even the possibility of love and of family happiness&mdash;floated continually in her imagination like temptations of the devil. Thrust them aside as she would, questions continually recurred to her as to how she would order her life now, after that. These were temptations of the devil and Princess Mary knew it. She knew that the sole weapon against him was prayer, and she tried to pray.</p>",
  "page-460": "<p> She assumed an attitude of prayer, looked at the icons, repeated the words of a prayer, but she could not pray. She felt that a different world had now taken possession of her&mdash;the life of a world of strenuous and free activity, quite opposed to the spiritual world in which till now she had been confined and in which her greatest comfort had been prayer. She could not pray, could not weep, and worldly cares took possession of her.</p><p>It was becoming dangerous to remain in Boguchárovo. News of the approach of the French came from all sides, and in one village, ten miles from Boguchárovo, a homestead had been looted by French marauders.</p>",
  "page-461": "<p>The doctor insisted on the necessity of moving the prince; the provincial Marshal of the Nobility sent an official to Princess Mary to persuade her to get away as quickly as possible, and the head of the rural police having come to Boguchárovo urged the same thing, saying that the French were only some twenty-five miles away, that French proclamations were circulating in the villages, and that if the princess did not take her father away before the fifteenth, he could not answer for the consequences.</p><p>The princess decided to leave on the fifteenth. The cares of preparation and giving orders, for which everyone came to her, occupied her all day. She spent the night of the fourteenth as usual, without undressing, in the room next to the one where the prince lay.</p>",
  "page-462": "<p> Several times, waking up, she heard his groans and muttering, the creak of his bed, and the steps of Tíkhon and the doctor when they turned him over. Several times she listened at the door, and it seemed to her that his mutterings were louder than usual and that they turned him over oftener. She could not sleep and several times went to the door and listened, wishing to enter but not deciding to do so. Though he did not speak, Princess Mary saw and knew how unpleasant every sign of anxiety on his account was to him. She had noticed with what dissatisfaction he turned from the look she sometimes involuntarily fixed on him. She knew that her going in during the night at an unusual hour would irritate him.</p><p>But never had she felt so grieved for him or so much afraid of losing him.</p>",
  "page-463": "<p> She recalled all her life with him and in every word and act of his found an expression of his love of her. Occasionally amid these memories temptations of the devil would surge into her imagination: thoughts of how things would be after his death, and how her new, liberated life would be ordered. But she drove these thoughts away with disgust. Toward morning he became quiet and she fell asleep.</p><p>She woke late. That sincerity which often comes with waking showed her clearly what chiefly concerned her about her father&rsquo;s illness. On waking she listened to what was going on behind the door and, hearing him groan, said to herself with a sigh that things were still the same.</p>",
  "page-464": "<p>&ldquo;But what could have happened? What did I want? I want his death!&rdquo; she cried with a feeling of loathing for herself.</p><p>She washed, dressed, said her prayers, and went out to the porch. In front of it stood carriages without horses and things were being packed into the vehicles.</p><p>It was a warm, gray morning. Princess Mary stopped at the porch, still horrified by her spiritual baseness and trying to arrange her thoughts before going to her father. The doctor came downstairs and went out to her.</p><p>&ldquo;He is a little better today,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I was looking for you. One can make out something of what he is saying. His head is clearer. Come in, he is asking for you....&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-465": "<p>Princess Mary&rsquo;s heart beat so violently at this news that she grew pale and leaned against the wall to keep from falling. To see him, talk to him, feel his eyes on her now that her whole soul was overflowing with those dreadful, wicked temptations, was a torment of joy and terror.</p><p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the doctor.</p><p>Princess Mary entered her father&rsquo;s room and went up to his bed. He was lying on his back propped up high, and his small bony hands with their knotted purple veins were lying on the quilt; his left eye gazed straight before him, his right eye was awry, and his brows and lips motionless. He seemed altogether so thin, small, and pathetic. His face seemed to have shriveled or melted; his features had grown smaller. Princess Mary went up and kissed his hand. His left hand pressed hers so that she understood that he had long been waiting for her to come. He twitched her hand, and his brows and lips quivered angrily.</p>",
  "page-466": "<p>She looked at him in dismay trying to guess what he wanted of her. When she changed her position so that his left eye could see her face he calmed down, not taking his eyes off her for some seconds. Then his lips and tongue moved, sounds came, and he began to speak, gazing timidly and imploringly at her, evidently afraid that she might not understand.</p><p>Straining all her faculties Princess Mary looked at him. The comic efforts with which he moved his tongue made her drop her eyes and with difficulty repress the sobs that rose to her throat. He said something, repeating the same words several times. She could not understand them, but tried to guess what he was saying and inquiringly repeated the words he uttered.</p>",
  "page-467": "<p>&ldquo;Mmm...ar...ate...ate...&rdquo; he repeated several times.</p><p>It was quite impossible to understand these sounds. The doctor thought he had guessed them, and inquiringly repeated: &ldquo;Mary, are you afraid?&rdquo; The prince shook his head, again repeated the same sounds.</p><p>&ldquo;My mind, my mind aches?&rdquo; questioned Princess Mary.</p><p>He made a mumbling sound in confirmation of this, took her hand, and began pressing it to different parts of his breast as if trying to find the right place for it.</p><p>&ldquo;Always thoughts... about you... thoughts...&rdquo; he then uttered much more clearly than he had done before, now that he was sure of being understood.</p>",
  "page-468": "<p>Princess Mary pressed her head against his hand, trying to hide her sobs and tears.</p><p>He moved his hand over her hair.</p><p>&ldquo;I have been calling you all night...&rdquo; he brought out.</p><p>&ldquo;If only I had known...&rdquo; she said through her tears. &ldquo;I was afraid to come in.&rdquo;</p><p>He pressed her hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you asleep?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I did not sleep,&rdquo; said Princess Mary, shaking her head.</p>",
  "page-469": "<p>Unconsciously imitating her father, she now tried to express herself as he did, as much as possible by signs, and her tongue too seemed to move with difficulty.</p><p>&ldquo;Dear one... Dearest...&rdquo; Princess Mary could not quite make out what he had said, but from his look it was clear that he had uttered a tender caressing word such as he had never used to her before. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come in?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I was wishing for his death!&rdquo; thought Princess Mary.</p><p>He was silent awhile.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you... daughter dear!... for all, for all... forgive!... thank you!... forgive!... thank you!...&rdquo; and tears began to flow from his eyes.</p>",
  "page-470": "<p> &ldquo;Call Andrew!&rdquo; he said suddenly, and a childish, timid expression of doubt showed itself on his face as he spoke.</p><p>He himself seemed aware that his demand was meaningless. So at least it seemed to Princess Mary.</p><p>&ldquo;I have a letter from him,&rdquo; she replied.</p><p>He glanced at her with timid surprise.</p><p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s with the army, Father, at Smolénsk.&rdquo;</p><p>He closed his eyes and remained silent a long time. Then as if in answer to his doubts and to confirm the fact that now he understood and remembered everything, he nodded his head and reopened his eyes.</p>",
  "page-471": "<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, softly and distinctly. &ldquo;Russia has perished. They&rsquo;ve destroyed her.&rdquo;</p><p>And he began to sob, and again tears flowed from his eyes. Princess Mary could no longer restrain herself and wept while she gazed at his face.</p><p>Again he closed his eyes. His sobs ceased, he pointed to his eyes, and Tíkhon, understanding him, wiped away the tears.</p><p>Then he again opened his eyes and said something none of them could understand for a long time, till at last Tíkhon understood and repeated it. Princess Mary had sought the meaning of his words in the mood in which he had just been speaking. She thought he was speaking of Russia, or Prince Andrew, of herself, of his grandson, or of his own death, and so she could not guess his words.</p>",
  "page-472": "<p>&ldquo;Put on your white dress. I like it,&rdquo; was what he said.</p><p>Having understood this Princess Mary sobbed still louder, and the doctor taking her arm led her out to the veranda, soothing her and trying to persuade her to prepare for her journey. When she had left the room the prince again began speaking about his son, about the war, and about the Emperor, angrily twitching his brows and raising his hoarse voice, and then he had a second and final stroke.</p><p>Princess Mary stayed on the veranda. The day had cleared, it was hot and sunny. She could understand nothing, think of nothing and feel nothing, except passionate love for her father, love such as she thought she had never felt till that moment. She ran out sobbing into the garden and as far as the pond, along the avenues of young lime trees Prince Andrew had planted.</p>",
  "page-473": "<p>&ldquo;Yes... I... I... I wished for his death! Yes, I wanted it to end quicker.... I wished to be at peace.... And what will become of me? What use will peace be when he is no longer here?&rdquo; Princess Mary murmured, pacing the garden with hurried steps and pressing her hands to her bosom which heaved with convulsive sobs.</p><p>When she had completed the tour of the garden, which brought her again to the house, she saw Mademoiselle Bourienne&mdash;who had remained at Boguchárovo and did not wish to leave it&mdash;coming toward her with a stranger. This was the Marshal of the Nobility of the district, who had come personally to point out to the princess the necessity for her prompt departure. Princess Mary listened without understanding him; she led him to the house, offered him lunch, and sat down with him.</p>",
  "page-474": "<p> Then, excusing herself, she went to the door of the old prince&rsquo;s room. The doctor came out with an agitated face and said she could not enter.</p><p>&ldquo;Go away, Princess! Go away... go away!&rdquo;</p><p>She returned to the garden and sat down on the grass at the foot of the slope by the pond, where no one could see her. She did not know how long she had been there when she was aroused by the sound of a woman&rsquo;s footsteps running along the path. She rose and saw Dunyásha her maid, who was evidently looking for her, and who stopped suddenly as if in alarm on seeing her mistress.</p>",
  "page-475": "<p>&ldquo;Please come, Princess... The Prince,&rdquo; said Dunyásha in a breaking voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Immediately, I&rsquo;m coming, I&rsquo;m coming!&rdquo; replied the princess hurriedly, not giving Dunyásha time to finish what she was saying, and trying to avoid seeing the girl she ran toward the house.</p><p>&ldquo;Princess, it&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s will! You must be prepared for everything,&rdquo; said the Marshal, meeting her at the house door.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me alone; it&rsquo;s not true!&rdquo; she cried angrily to him.</p><p>The doctor tried to stop her. She pushed him aside and ran to her father&rsquo;s door. &ldquo;Why are these people with frightened faces stopping me? I don&rsquo;t want any of them! And what are they doing here?&rdquo; she thought. She opened the door and the bright daylight in that previously darkened room startled her. In the room were her nurse and other women.</p>",
  "page-476": "<p> They all drew back from the bed, making way for her. He was still lying on the bed as before, but the stern expression of his quiet face made Princess Mary stop short on the threshold.</p><p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s not dead&mdash;it&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo; she told herself and approached him, and repressing the terror that seized her, she pressed her lips to his cheek. But she stepped back immediately. All the force of the tenderness she had been feeling for him vanished instantly and was replaced by a feeling of horror at what lay there before her. &ldquo;No, he is no more! He is not, but here where he was is something unfamiliar and hostile, some dreadful, terrifying, and repellent mystery!&rdquo; And hiding her face in her hands, Princess Mary sank into the arms of the doctor, who held her up.</p>",
  "page-477": "<p>In the presence of Tíkhon and the doctor the women washed what had been the prince, tied his head up with a handkerchief that the mouth should not stiffen while open, and with another handkerchief tied together the legs that were already spreading apart. Then they dressed him in uniform with his decorations and placed his shriveled little body on a table. Heaven only knows who arranged all this and when, but it all got done as if of its own accord. Toward night candles were burning round his coffin, a pall was spread over it, the floor was strewn with sprays of juniper, a printed band was tucked in under his shriveled head, and in a corner of the room sat a chanter reading the psalms.</p>",
  "page-478": "<p>Just as horses shy and snort and gather about a dead horse, so the inmates of the house and strangers crowded into the drawing room round the coffin&mdash;the Marshal, the village Elder, peasant women&mdash;and all with fixed and frightened eyes, crossing themselves, bowed and kissed the old prince&rsquo;s cold and stiffened hand.</p>",
  "page-479": "<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>",
  "page-480": "<p>Until Prince Andrew settled in Boguchárovo its owners had always been absentees, and its peasants were of quite a different character from those of Bald Hills. They differed from them in speech, dress, and disposition. They were called steppe peasants. The old prince used to approve of them for their endurance at work when they came to Bald Hills to help with the harvest or to dig ponds, and ditches, but he disliked them for their boorishness.</p><p>Prince Andrew&rsquo;s last stay at Boguchárovo, when he introduced hospitals and schools and reduced the quitrent the peasants had to pay, had not softened their disposition but had on the contrary strengthened in them the traits of character the old prince called boorishness. Various obscure rumors were always current among them: at one time a rumor that they would all be enrolled as Cossacks;</p>",
  "page-481": "<p> at another of a new religion to which they were all to be converted; then of some proclamation of the Tsar&rsquo;s and of an oath to the Tsar Paul in 1797 (in connection with which it was rumored that freedom had been granted them but the landowners had stopped it), then of Peter Fëdorovich&rsquo;s return to the throne in seven years&rsquo; time, when everything would be made free and so &ldquo;simple&rdquo; that there would be no restrictions. Rumors of the war with Bonaparte and his invasion were connected in their minds with the same sort of vague notions of Antichrist, the end of the world, and &ldquo;pure freedom.&rdquo;</p><p>In the vicinity of Boguchárovo were large villages belonging to the crown or to owners whose serfs paid quitrent and could work where they pleased.</p>",
  "page-482": "<p> There were very few resident landlords in the neighborhood and also very few domestic or literate serfs, and in the lives of the peasantry of those parts the mysterious undercurrents in the life of the Russian people, the causes and meaning of which are so baffling to contemporaries, were more clearly and strongly noticeable than among others. One instance, which had occurred some twenty years before, was a movement among the peasants to emigrate to some unknown &ldquo;warm rivers.&rdquo; Hundreds of peasants, among them the Boguchárovo folk, suddenly began selling their cattle and moving in whole families toward the southeast. As birds migrate to somewhere beyond the sea, so these men with their wives and children streamed to the southeast, to parts where none of them had ever been. They set off in caravans, bought their freedom one by one or ran away, and drove or walked toward the &ldquo;warm rivers.</p>",
  "page-483": "<p>&rdquo; Many of them were punished, some sent to Siberia, many died of cold and hunger on the road, many returned of their own accord, and the movement died down of itself just as it had sprung up, without apparent reason. But such undercurrents still existed among the people and gathered new forces ready to manifest themselves just as strangely, unexpectedly, and at the same time simply, naturally, and forcibly. Now in 1812, to anyone living in close touch with these people it was apparent that these undercurrents were acting strongly and nearing an eruption.</p><p>Alpátych, who had reached Boguchárovo shortly before the old prince&rsquo;s death, noticed an agitation among the peasants, and that contrary to what was happening in the Bald Hills district, where over a radius of forty miles all the peasants were moving away and leaving their villages to be devastated by the Cossacks, the peasants in the steppe region round</p>",
  "page-484": "<p>Boguchárovo were, it was rumored, in touch with the French, received leaflets from them that passed from hand to hand, and did not migrate. He learned from domestic serfs loyal to him that the peasant Karp, who possessed great influence in the village commune and had recently been away driving a government transport, had returned with news that the Cossacks were destroying deserted villages, but that the French did not harm them. Alpátych also knew that on the previous day another peasant had even brought from the village of Visloúkhovo, which was occupied by the French, a proclamation by a French general that no harm would be done to the inhabitants, and if they remained they would be paid for anything taken from them. As proof of this the peasant had brought from Visloúkhovo a hundred rubles in notes (he did not know that they were false) paid to him in advance for hay.</p>",
  "page-485": "<p>More important still, Alpátych learned that on the morning of the very day he gave the village Elder orders to collect carts to move the princess&rsquo; luggage from Boguchárovo, there had been a village meeting at which it had been decided not to move but to wait. Yet there was no time to waste. On the fifteenth, the day of the old prince&rsquo;s death, the Marshal had insisted on Princess Mary&rsquo;s leaving at once, as it was becoming dangerous. He had told her that after the sixteenth he could not be responsible for what might happen. On the evening of the day the old prince died the Marshal went away, promising to return next day for the funeral. But this he was unable to do, for he received tidings that the French had unexpectedly advanced, and had barely time to remove his own family and valuables from his estate.</p>",
  "page-486": "<p>For some thirty years Boguchárovo had been managed by the village Elder, Dron, whom the old prince called by the diminutive &ldquo;Drónushka.&rdquo;</p><p>Dron was one of those physically and mentally vigorous peasants who grow big beards as soon as they are of age and go on unchanged till they are sixty or seventy, without a gray hair or the loss of a tooth, as straight and strong at sixty as at thirty.</p><p>Soon after the migration to the &ldquo;warm rivers,&rdquo; in which he had taken part like the rest, Dron was made village Elder and overseer of Boguchárovo, and had since filled that post irreproachably for twenty-three years. The peasants feared him more than they did their master. The masters, both the old prince and the young, and the steward respected him and jestingly called him &ldquo;the Minister.</p>",
  "page-487": "<p>&rdquo; During the whole time of his service Dron had never been drunk or ill, never after sleepless nights or the hardest tasks had he shown the least fatigue, and though he could not read he had never forgotten a single money account or the number of quarters of flour in any of the endless cartloads he sold for the prince, nor a single shock of the whole corn crop on any single acre of the Boguchárovo fields.</p><p>Alpátych, arriving from the devastated Bald Hills estate, sent for his Dron on the day of the prince&rsquo;s funeral and told him to have twelve horses got ready for the princess&rsquo; carriages and eighteen carts for the things to be removed from Boguchárovo. Though the peasants paid quitrent, Alpátych thought no difficulty would be made about complying with this order, for there were two hundred and thirty households at work in Boguchárovo and the peasants were well to do.</p>",
  "page-488": "<p> But on hearing the order Dron lowered his eyes and remained silent. Alpátych named certain peasants he knew, from whom he told him to take the carts.</p><p>Dron replied that the horses of these peasants were away carting. Alpátych named others, but they too, according to Dron, had no horses available: some horses were carting for the government, others were too weak, and others had died for want of fodder. It seemed that no horses could be had even for the carriages, much less for the carting.</p><p>Alpátych looked intently at Dron and frowned. Just as Dron was a model village Elder, so Alpátych had not managed the prince&rsquo;s estates for twenty years in vain. He was a model steward, possessing in the highest degree the faculty of divining the needs and instincts of those he dealt with.</p>",
  "page-489": "<p> Having glanced at Dron he at once understood that his answers did not express his personal views but the general mood of the Boguchárovo commune, by which the Elder had already been carried away. But he also knew that Dron, who had acquired property and was hated by the commune, must be hesitating between the two camps: the masters&rsquo; and the serfs&rsquo;. He noticed this hesitation in Dron&rsquo;s look and therefore frowned and moved closer up to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Now just listen, Drónushka,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense to me. His excellency Prince Andrew himself gave me orders to move all the people away and not leave them with the enemy, and there is an order from the Tsar about it too. Anyone who stays is a traitor to the Tsar. Do you hear?&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-490": "<p>&ldquo;I hear,&rdquo; Dron answered without lifting his eyes.</p><p>Alpátych was not satisfied with this reply.</p><p>&ldquo;Eh, Dron, it will turn out badly!&rdquo; he said, shaking his head.</p><p>&ldquo;The power is in your hands,&rdquo; Dron rejoined sadly.</p><p>&ldquo;Eh, Dron, drop it!&rdquo; Alpátych repeated, withdrawing his hand from his bosom and solemnly pointing to the floor at Dron&rsquo;s feet. &ldquo;I can see through you and three yards into the ground under you,&rdquo; he continued, gazing at the floor in front of Dron.</p><p>Dron was disconcerted, glanced furtively at Alpátych and again lowered his eyes.</p>",
  "page-491": "<p>&ldquo;You drop this nonsense and tell the people to get ready to leave their homes and go to Moscow and to get carts ready for tomorrow morning for the princess&rsquo; things. And don&rsquo;t go to any meeting yourself, do you hear?&rdquo;</p><p>Dron suddenly fell on his knees.</p><p>&ldquo;Yákov Alpátych, discharge me! Take the keys from me and discharge me, for Christ&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop that!&rdquo; cried Alpátych sternly. &ldquo;I see through you and three yards under you,&rdquo; he repeated, knowing that his skill in beekeeping, his knowledge of the right time to sow the oats, and the fact that he had been able to retain the old prince&rsquo;s favor for twenty years had long since gained him the reputation of being a wizard, and that the power of seeing three yards under a man is considered an attribute of wizards.</p>",
  "page-492": "<p>Dron got up and was about to say something, but Alpátych interrupted him.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it you have got into your heads, eh?... What are you thinking of, eh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What am I to do with the people?&rdquo; said Dron. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re quite beside themselves; I have already told them...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Told them,&rsquo; I dare say!&rdquo; said Alpátych. &ldquo;Are they drinking?&rdquo; he asked abruptly.</p><p>&ldquo;Quite beside themselves, Yákov Alpátych; they&rsquo;ve fetched another barrel.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-493": "<p>&ldquo;Well, then, listen! I&rsquo;ll go to the police officer, and you tell them so, and that they must stop this and the carts must be got ready.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;</p><p>Alpátych did not insist further. He had managed people for a long time and knew that the chief way to make them obey is to show no suspicion that they can possibly disobey. Having wrung a submissive &ldquo;I understand&rdquo; from Dron, Alpátych contented himself with that, though he not only doubted but felt almost certain that without the help of troops the carts would not be forthcoming.</p><p>And so it was, for when evening came no carts had been provided. In the village, outside the drink shop, another meeting was being held, which decided that the horses should be driven out into the woods and the carts should not be provided.</p>",
  "page-494": "<p> Without saying anything of this to the princess, Alpátych had his own belongings taken out of the carts which had arrived from Bald Hills and had those horses got ready for the princess&rsquo; carriages. Meanwhile he went himself to the police authorities.</p>",
  "page-495": "<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>",
  "page-496": "<p>After her father&rsquo;s funeral Princess Mary shut herself up in her room and did not admit anyone. A maid came to the door to say that Alpátych was asking for orders about their departure. (This was before his talk with Dron.) Princess Mary raised herself on the sofa on which she had been lying and replied through the closed door that she did not mean to go away and begged to be left in peace.</p><p>The windows of the room in which she was lying looked westward. She lay on the sofa with her face to the wall, fingering the buttons of the leather cushion and seeing nothing but that cushion, and her confused thoughts were centered on one subject&mdash;the irrevocability of death and her own spiritual baseness, which she had not suspected, but which had shown itself during her father&rsquo;s illness.</p>",
  "page-497": "<p> She wished to pray but did not dare to, dared not in her present state of mind address herself to God. She lay for a long time in that position.</p><p>The sun had reached the other side of the house, and its slanting rays shone into the open window, lighting up the room and part of the morocco cushion at which Princess Mary was looking. The flow of her thoughts suddenly stopped. Unconsciously she sat up, smoothed her hair, got up, and went to the window, involuntarily inhaling the freshness of the clear but windy evening.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, you can well enjoy the evening now! He is gone and no one will hinder you,&rdquo; she said to herself, and sinking into a chair she let her head fall on the window sill.</p>",
  "page-498": "<p>Someone spoke her name in a soft and tender voice from the garden and kissed her head. She looked up. It was Mademoiselle Bourienne in a black dress and weepers. She softly approached Princess Mary, sighed, kissed her, and immediately began to cry. The princess looked up at her. All their former disharmony and her own jealousy recurred to her mind. But she remembered too how he had changed of late toward Mademoiselle Bourienne and could not bear to see her, thereby showing how unjust were the reproaches Princess Mary had mentally addressed to her. &ldquo;Besides, is it for me, for me who desired his death, to condemn anyone?&rdquo; she thought.</p><p>Princess Mary vividly pictured to herself the position of Mademoiselle Bourienne, whom she had of late kept at a distance, but who yet was dependent on her and living in her house.</p>",
  "page-499": "<p> She felt sorry for her and held out her hand with a glance of gentle inquiry. Mademoiselle Bourienne at once began crying again and kissed that hand, speaking of the princess&rsquo; sorrow and making herself a partner in it. She said her only consolation was the fact that the princess allowed her to share her sorrow, that all the old misunderstandings should sink into nothing but this great grief; that she felt herself blameless in regard to everyone, and that he, from above, saw her affection and gratitude. The princess heard her, not heeding her words but occasionally looking up at her and listening to the sound of her voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Your position is doubly terrible, dear princess,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle Bourienne after a pause. &ldquo;I understand that you could not, and cannot, think of yourself, but with my love for you I must do so.... Has Alpátych been to you? Has he spoken to you of going away?&rdquo; she asked.</p>",
  "page-500": "<p>Princess Mary did not answer. She did not understand who was to go or where to. &ldquo;Is it possible to plan or think of anything now? Is it not all the same?&rdquo; she thought, and did not reply.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, chère Marie,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle Bourienne, &ldquo;that we are in danger&mdash;are surrounded by the French. It would be dangerous to move now. If we go we are almost sure to be taken prisoners, and God knows...&rdquo;</p><p>Princess Mary looked at her companion without understanding what she was talking about.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, if anyone knew how little anything matters to me now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Of course I would on no account wish to go away from him.... Alpátych did say something about going.... Speak to him; I can do nothing, nothing, and don&rsquo;t want to....&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-501": "<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve spoken to him. He hopes we should be in time to get away tomorrow, but I think it would now be better to stay here,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle Bourienne. &ldquo;Because, you will agree, chère Marie, to fall into the hands of the soldiers or of riotous peasants would be terrible.&rdquo;</p><p>Mademoiselle Bourienne took from her reticule a proclamation (not printed on ordinary Russian paper) of General Rameau&rsquo;s, telling people not to leave their homes and that the French authorities would afford them proper protection. She handed this to the princess.</p><p>&ldquo;I think it would be best to appeal to that general,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;and I am sure that all due respect would be shown you.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-502": "<p>Princess Mary read the paper, and her face began to quiver with stifled sobs.</p><p>&ldquo;From whom did you get this?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>&ldquo;They probably recognized that I am French, by my name,&rdquo; replied Mademoiselle Bourienne blushing.</p><p>Princess Mary, with the paper in her hand, rose from the window and with a pale face went out of the room and into what had been Prince Andrew&rsquo;s study.</p><p>&ldquo;Dunyásha, send Alpátych, or Drónushka, or somebody to me!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and tell Mademoiselle Bourienne not to come to me,&rdquo; she added, hearing Mademoiselle Bourienne&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;We must go at once, at once!&rdquo; she said, appalled at the thought of being left in the hands of the French.</p>",
  "page-503": "<p>&ldquo;If Prince Andrew heard that I was in the power of the French! That I, the daughter of Prince Nicholas Bolkónski, asked General Rameau for protection and accepted his favor!&rdquo; This idea horrified her, made her shudder, blush, and feel such a rush of anger and pride as she had never experienced before. All that was distressing, and especially all that was humiliating, in her position rose vividly to her mind. &ldquo;They, the French, would settle in this house: M. le Général Rameau would occupy Prince Andrew&rsquo;s study and amuse himself by looking through and reading his letters and papers. Mademoiselle Bourienne would do the honors of Boguchárovo for him. I should be given a small room as a favor, the soldiers would violate my father&rsquo;s newly dug grave to steal his crosses and stars, they would tell me of their victories over the Russians, and would pretend to sympathize with my sorrow...</p>",
  "page-504": "<p>&rdquo; thought Princess Mary, not thinking her own thoughts but feeling bound to think like her father and her brother. For herself she did not care where she remained or what happened to her, but she felt herself the representative of her dead father and of Prince Andrew. Involuntarily she thought their thoughts and felt their feelings. What they would have said and what they would have done she felt bound to say and do. She went into Prince Andrew&rsquo;s study, trying to enter completely into his ideas, and considered her position.</p><p>The demands of life, which had seemed to her annihilated by her father&rsquo;s death, all at once rose before her with a new, previously unknown force and took possession of her.</p>",
  "page-505": "<p>Agitated and flushed she paced the room, sending now for Michael Ivánovich and now for Tíkhon or Dron. Dunyásha, the nurse, and the other maids could not say in how far Mademoiselle Bourienne&rsquo;s statement was correct. Alpátych was not at home, he had gone to the police. Neither could the architect Michael Ivánovich, who on being sent for came in with sleepy eyes, tell Princess Mary anything. With just the same smile of agreement with which for fifteen years he had been accustomed to answer the old prince without expressing views of his own, he now replied to Princess Mary, so that nothing definite could be got from his answers. The old valet Tíkhon, with sunken, emaciated face that bore the stamp of inconsolable grief, replied: &ldquo;Yes, Princess&rdquo; to all Princess Mary&rsquo;s questions and hardly refrained from sobbing as he looked at her.</p>",
  "page-506": "<p>At length Dron, the village Elder, entered the room and with a deep bow to Princess Mary came to a halt by the doorpost.</p><p>Princess Mary walked up and down the room and stopped in front of him.</p><p>&ldquo;Drónushka,&rdquo; she said, regarding as a sure friend this Drónushka who always used to bring a special kind of gingerbread from his visit to the fair at Vyázma every year and smilingly offer it to her, &ldquo;Drónushka, now since our misfortune...&rdquo; she began, but could not go on.</p><p>&ldquo;We are all in God&rsquo;s hands,&rdquo; said he, with a sigh.</p>",
  "page-507": "<p>They were silent for a while.</p><p>&ldquo;Drónushka, Alpátych has gone off somewhere and I have no one to turn to. Is it true, as they tell me, that I can&rsquo;t even go away?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t you go away, your excellency? You can go,&rdquo; said Dron.</p><p>&ldquo;I was told it would be dangerous because of the enemy. Dear friend, I can do nothing. I understand nothing. I have nobody! I want to go away tonight or early tomorrow morning.&rdquo;</p><p>Dron paused. He looked askance at Princess Mary and said: &ldquo;There are no horses; I told Yákov Alpátych so.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-508": "<p>&ldquo;Why are there none?&rdquo; asked the princess.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all God&rsquo;s scourge,&rdquo; said Dron. &ldquo;What horses we had have been taken for the army or have died&mdash;this is such a year! It&rsquo;s not a case of feeding horses&mdash;we may die of hunger ourselves! As it is, some go three days without eating. We&rsquo;ve nothing, we&rsquo;ve been ruined.&rdquo;</p><p>Princess Mary listened attentively to what he told her.</p><p>&ldquo;The peasants are ruined? They have no bread?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re dying of hunger,&rdquo; said Dron. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a case of carting.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-509": "<p>&ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you tell me, Drónushka? Isn&rsquo;t it possible to help them? I&rsquo;ll do all I can....&rdquo;</p><p>To Princess Mary it was strange that now, at a moment when such sorrow was filling her soul, there could be rich people and poor, and the rich could refrain from helping the poor. She had heard vaguely that there was such a thing as &ldquo;landlord&rsquo;s corn&rdquo; which was sometimes given to the peasants. She also knew that neither her father nor her brother would refuse to help the peasants in need, she only feared to make some mistake in speaking about the distribution of the grain she wished to give. She was glad such cares presented themselves, enabling her without scruple to forget her own grief. She began asking Dron about the peasants&rsquo; needs and what there was in Boguchárovo that belonged to the landlord.</p>",
  "page-510": "<p>&ldquo;But we have grain belonging to my brother?&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;The landlord&rsquo;s grain is all safe,&rdquo; replied Dron proudly. &ldquo;Our prince did not order it to be sold.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Give it to the peasants, let them have all they need; I give you leave in my brother&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; said she.</p><p>Dron made no answer but sighed deeply.</p><p>&ldquo;Give them that corn if there is enough of it. Distribute it all. I give this order in my brother&rsquo;s name; and tell them that what is ours is theirs. We do not grudge them anything. Tell them so.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-511": "<p>Dron looked intently at the princess while she was speaking.</p><p>&ldquo;Discharge me, little mother, for God&rsquo;s sake! Order the keys to be taken from me,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have served twenty-three years and have done no wrong. Discharge me, for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p><p>Princess Mary did not understand what he wanted of her or why he was asking to be discharged. She replied that she had never doubted his devotion and that she was ready to do anything for him and for the peasants.</p>",
  "page-512": "<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>",
  "page-513": "<p>An hour later Dunyásha came to tell the princess that Dron had come, and all the peasants had assembled at the barn by the princess&rsquo; order and wished to have word with their mistress.</p><p>&ldquo;But I never told them to come,&rdquo; said Princess Mary. &ldquo;I only told Dron to let them have the grain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Only, for God&rsquo;s sake, Princess dear, have them sent away and don&rsquo;t go out to them. It&rsquo;s all a trick,&rdquo; said Dunyásha, &ldquo;and when Yákov Alpátych returns let us get away... and please don&rsquo;t...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is a trick?&rdquo; asked Princess Mary in surprise.</p>",
  "page-514": "<p>&ldquo;I know it is, only listen to me for God&rsquo;s sake! Ask nurse too. They say they don&rsquo;t agree to leave Boguchárovo as you ordered.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re making some mistake. I never ordered them to go away,&rdquo; said Princess Mary. &ldquo;Call Drónushka.&rdquo;</p><p>Dron came and confirmed Dunyásha&rsquo;s words; the peasants had come by the princess&rsquo; order.</p><p>&ldquo;But I never sent for them,&rdquo; declared the princess. &ldquo;You must have given my message wrong. I only said that you were to give them the grain.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-515": "<p>Dron only sighed in reply.</p><p>&ldquo;If you order it they will go away,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>&ldquo;No, no. I&rsquo;ll go out to them,&rdquo; said Princess Mary, and in spite of the nurse&rsquo;s and Dunyásha&rsquo;s protests she went out into the porch; Dron, Dunyásha, the nurse, and Michael Ivánovich following her.</p><p>&ldquo;They probably think I am offering them the grain to bribe them to remain here, while I myself go away leaving them to the mercy of the French,&rdquo; thought Princess Mary. &ldquo;I will offer them monthly rations and housing at our Moscow estate. I am sure Andrew would do even more in my place,&rdquo; she thought as she went out in the twilight toward the crowd standing on the pasture by the barn.</p>",
  "page-516": "<p>The men crowded closer together, stirred, and rapidly took off their hats. Princess Mary lowered her eyes and, tripping over her skirt, came close up to them. So many different eyes, old and young, were fixed on her, and there were so many different faces, that she could not distinguish any of them and, feeling that she must speak to them all at once, did not know how to do it. But again the sense that she represented her father and her brother gave her courage, and she boldly began her speech.</p><p>&ldquo;I am very glad you have come,&rdquo; she said without raising her eyes, and feeling her heart beating quickly and violently. &ldquo;Drónushka tells me that the war has ruined you. That is our common misfortune, and I shall grudge nothing to help you. I am myself going away because it is dangerous here... the enemy is near... because...</p>",
  "page-517": "<p> I am giving you everything, my friends, and I beg you to take everything, all our grain, so that you may not suffer want! And if you have been told that I am giving you the grain to keep you here&mdash;that is not true. On the contrary, I ask you to go with all your belongings to our estate near Moscow, and I promise you I will see to it that there you shall want for nothing. You shall be given food and lodging.&rdquo;</p><p>The princess stopped. Sighs were the only sound heard in the crowd.</p><p>&ldquo;I am not doing this on my own account,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I do it in the name of my dead father, who was a good master to you, and of my brother and his son.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-518": "<p>Again she paused. No one broke the silence.</p><p>&ldquo;Ours is a common misfortune and we will share it together. All that is mine is yours,&rdquo; she concluded, scanning the faces before her.</p><p>All eyes were gazing at her with one and the same expression. She could not fathom whether it was curiosity, devotion, gratitude, or apprehension and distrust&mdash;but the expression on all the faces was identical.</p><p>&ldquo;We are all very thankful for your bounty, but it won&rsquo;t do for us to take the landlord&rsquo;s grain,&rdquo; said a voice at the back of the crowd.</p>",
  "page-519": "<p>&ldquo;But why not?&rdquo; asked the princess.</p><p>No one replied and Princess Mary, looking round at the crowd, found that every eye she met now was immediately dropped.</p><p>&ldquo;But why don&rsquo;t you want to take it?&rdquo; she asked again.</p><p>No one answered.</p><p>The silence began to oppress the princess and she tried to catch someone&rsquo;s eye.</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you speak?&rdquo; she inquired of a very old man who stood just in front of her leaning on his stick. &ldquo;If you think something more is wanted, tell me! I will do anything,&rdquo; said she, catching his eye.</p>",
  "page-520": "<p>But as if this angered him, he bent his head quite low and muttered:</p><p>&ldquo;Why should we agree? We don&rsquo;t want the grain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why should we give up everything? We don&rsquo;t agree. Don&rsquo;t agree.... We are sorry for you, but we&rsquo;re not willing. Go away yourself, alone...&rdquo; came from various sides of the crowd.</p><p>And again all the faces in that crowd bore an identical expression, though now it was certainly not an expression of curiosity or gratitude, but of angry resolve.</p><p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t have understood me,&rdquo; said Princess Mary with a sad smile. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you want to go? I promise to house and feed you, while here the enemy would ruin you....&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-521": "<p>But her voice was drowned by the voices of the crowd.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not willing. Let them ruin us! We won&rsquo;t take your grain. We don&rsquo;t agree.&rdquo;</p><p>Again Princess Mary tried to catch someone&rsquo;s eye, but not a single eye in the crowd was turned to her; evidently they were all trying to avoid her look. She felt strange and awkward.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yes, an artful tale! Follow her into slavery! Pull down your houses and go into bondage! I dare say! &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give you grain, indeed!&rsquo; she says,&rdquo; voices in the crowd were heard saying.</p>",
  "page-522": "<p>With drooping head Princess Mary left the crowd and went back to the house. Having repeated her order to Dron to have horses ready for her departure next morning, she went to her room and remained alone with her own thoughts.</p>",
  "page-523": "<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>",
  "page-524": "<p>For a long time that night Princess Mary sat by the open window of her room hearing the sound of the peasants&rsquo; voices that reached her from the village, but it was not of them she was thinking. She felt that she could not understand them however much she might think about them. She thought only of one thing, her sorrow, which, after the break caused by cares for the present, seemed already to belong to the past. Now she could remember it and weep or pray.</p><p>After sunset the wind had dropped. The night was calm and fresh. Toward midnight the voices began to subside, a cock crowed, the full moon began to show from behind the lime trees, a fresh white dewy mist began to rise, and stillness reigned over the village and the house.</p>",
  "page-525": "<p>Pictures of the near past&mdash;her father&rsquo;s illness and last moments&mdash;rose one after another to her memory. With mournful pleasure she now lingered over these images, repelling with horror only the last one, the picture of his death, which she felt she could not contemplate even in imagination at this still and mystic hour of night. And these pictures presented themselves to her so clearly and in such detail that they seemed now present, now past, and now future.</p><p>She vividly recalled the moment when he had his first stroke and was being dragged along by his armpits through the garden at Bald Hills, muttering something with his helpless tongue, twitching his gray eyebrows and looking uneasily and timidly at her.</p>",
  "page-526": "<p>&ldquo;Even then he wanted to tell me what he told me the day he died,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;He had always thought what he said then.&rdquo; And she recalled in all its detail the night at Bald Hills before he had the last stroke, when with a foreboding of disaster she had remained at home against his will. She had not slept and had stolen downstairs on tiptoe, and going to the door of the conservatory where he slept that night had listened at the door. In a suffering and weary voice he was saying something to Tíkhon, speaking of the Crimea and its warm nights and of the Empress. Evidently he had wanted to talk. &ldquo;And why didn&rsquo;t he call me? Why didn&rsquo;t he let me be there instead of Tíkhon?&rdquo; Princess Mary had thought and thought again now. &ldquo;Now he will never tell anyone what he had in his soul.</p>",
  "page-527": "<p> Never will that moment return for him or for me when he might have said all he longed to say, and not Tíkhon but I might have heard and understood him. Why didn&rsquo;t I enter the room?&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Perhaps he would then have said to me what he said the day he died. While talking to Tíkhon he asked about me twice. He wanted to see me, and I was standing close by, outside the door. It was sad and painful for him to talk to Tíkhon who did not understand him. I remember how he began speaking to him about Lise as if she were alive&mdash;he had forgotten she was dead&mdash;and Tíkhon reminded him that she was no more, and he shouted, &lsquo;Fool!&rsquo; He was greatly depressed.</p>",
  "page-528": "<p> From behind the door I heard how he lay down on his bed groaning and loudly exclaimed, &lsquo;My God!&rsquo; Why didn&rsquo;t I go in then? What could he have done to me? What could I have lost? And perhaps he would then have been comforted and would have said that word to me.&rdquo; And Princess Mary uttered aloud the caressing word he had said to her on the day of his death. &ldquo;Dear-est!&rdquo; she repeated, and began sobbing, with tears that relieved her soul. She now saw his face before her. And not the face she had known ever since she could remember and had always seen at a distance, but the timid, feeble face she had seen for the first time quite closely, with all its wrinkles and details, when she stooped near to his mouth to catch what he said.</p>",
  "page-529": "<p>&ldquo;Dear-est!&rdquo; she repeated again.</p><p>&ldquo;What was he thinking when he uttered that word? What is he thinking now?&rdquo; This question suddenly presented itself to her, and in answer she saw him before her with the expression that was on his face as he lay in his coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief. And the horror that had seized her when she touched him and convinced herself that that was not he, but something mysterious and horrible, seized her again. She tried to think of something else and to pray, but could do neither. With wide-open eyes she gazed at the moonlight and the shadows, expecting every moment to see his dead face, and she felt that the silence brooding over the house and within it held her fast.</p>",
  "page-530": "<p>&ldquo;Dunyásha,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Dunyásha!&rdquo; she screamed wildly, and tearing herself out of this silence she ran to the servants&rsquo; quarters to meet her old nurse and the maidservants who came running toward her.</p>",
  "page-531": "<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>",
  "page-532": "<p>On the seventeenth of August Rostóv and Ilyín, accompanied by Lavrúshka who had just returned from captivity and by an hussar orderly, left their quarters at Yankóvo, ten miles from Boguchárovo, and went for a ride&mdash;to try a new horse Ilyín had bought and to find out whether there was any hay to be had in the villages.</p><p>For the last three days Boguchárovo had lain between the two hostile armies, so that it was as easy for the Russian rearguard to get to it as for the French vanguard; Rostóv, as a careful squadron commander, wished to take such provisions as remained at Boguchárovo before the French could get them.</p>",
  "page-533": "<p>Rostóv and Ilyín were in the merriest of moods. On the way to Boguchárovo, a princely estate with a dwelling house and farm where they hoped to find many domestic serfs and pretty girls, they questioned Lavrúshka about Napoleon and laughed at his stories, and raced one another to try Ilyín&rsquo;s horse.</p><p>Rostóv had no idea that the village he was entering was the property of that very Bolkónski who had been engaged to his sister.</p><p>Rostóv and Ilyín gave rein to their horses for a last race along the incline before reaching Boguchárovo, and Rostóv, outstripping Ilyín, was the first to gallop into the village street.</p>",
  "page-534": "<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re first!&rdquo; cried Ilyín, flushed.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, always first both on the grassland and here,&rdquo; answered Rostóv, stroking his heated Donéts horse.</p><p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d have won on my Frenchy, your excellency,&rdquo; said Lavrúshka from behind, alluding to his shabby cart horse, &ldquo;only I didn&rsquo;t wish to mortify you.&rdquo;</p><p>They rode at a footpace to the barn, where a large crowd of peasants was standing.</p><p>Some of the men bared their heads, others stared at the new arrivals without doffing their caps. Two tall old peasants with wrinkled faces and scanty beards emerged from the tavern, smiling, staggering, and singing some incoherent song, and approached the officers.</p>",
  "page-535": "<p>&ldquo;Fine fellows!&rdquo; said Rostóv laughing. &ldquo;Is there any hay here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And how like one another,&rdquo; said Ilyín.</p><p>&ldquo;A mo-o-st me-r-r-y co-o-m-pa...!&rdquo; sang one of the peasants with a blissful smile.</p><p>One of the men came out of the crowd and went up to Rostóv.</p><p>&ldquo;Who do you belong to?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;The French,&rdquo; replied Ilyín jestingly, &ldquo;and here is Napoleon himself&rdquo;&mdash;and he pointed to Lavrúshka.</p><p>&ldquo;Then you are Russians?&rdquo; the peasant asked again.</p>",
  "page-536": "<p>&ldquo;And is there a large force of you here?&rdquo; said another, a short man, coming up.</p><p>&ldquo;Very large,&rdquo; answered Rostóv. &ldquo;But why have you collected here?&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Is it a holiday?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The old men have met to talk over the business of the commune,&rdquo; replied the peasant, moving away.</p><p>At that moment, on the road leading from the big house, two women and a man in a white hat were seen coming toward the officers.</p><p>&ldquo;The one in pink is mine, so keep off!&rdquo; said Ilyín on seeing Dunyásha running resolutely toward him.</p>",
  "page-537": "<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be ours!&rdquo; said Lavrúshka to Ilyín, winking.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want, my pretty?&rdquo; said Ilyín with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;The princess ordered me to ask your regiment and your name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is Count Rostóv, squadron commander, and I am your humble servant.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Co-o-om-pa-ny!&rdquo; roared the tipsy peasant with a beatific smile as he looked at Ilyín talking to the girl. Following Dunyásha, Alpátych advanced to Rostóv, having bared his head while still at a distance.</p>",
  "page-538": "<p>&ldquo;May I make bold to trouble your honor?&rdquo; said he respectfully, but with a shade of contempt for the youthfulness of this officer and with a hand thrust into his bosom. &ldquo;My mistress, daughter of General in Chief Prince Nicholas Bolkónski who died on the fifteenth of this month, finding herself in difficulties owing to the boorishness of these people&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed to the peasants&mdash;&ldquo;asks you to come up to the house.... Won&rsquo;t you, please, ride on a little farther,&rdquo; said Alpátych with a melancholy smile, &ldquo;as it is not convenient in the presence of...?&rdquo; He pointed to the two peasants who kept as close to him as horseflies to a horse.</p>",
  "page-539": "<p>&ldquo;Ah!... Alpátych... Ah, Yákov Alpátych... Grand! Forgive us for Christ&rsquo;s sake, eh?&rdquo; said the peasants, smiling joyfully at him.</p><p>Rostóv looked at the tipsy peasants and smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Or perhaps they amuse your honor?&rdquo; remarked Alpátych with a staid air, as he pointed at the old men with his free hand.</p><p>&ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s not much to be amused at here,&rdquo; said Rostóv, and rode on a little way. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I make bold to inform your honor that the rude peasants here don&rsquo;t wish to let the mistress leave the estate, and threaten to unharness her horses, so that though everything has been packed up since morning, her excellency cannot get away.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-540": "<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; exclaimed Rostóv.</p><p>&ldquo;I have the honor to report to you the actual truth,&rdquo; said Alpátych.</p><p>Rostóv dismounted, gave his horse to the orderly, and followed Alpátych to the house, questioning him as to the state of affairs. It appeared that the princess&rsquo; offer of corn to the peasants the previous day, and her talk with Dron and at the meeting, had actually had so bad an effect that Dron had finally given up the keys and joined the peasants and had not appeared when Alpátych sent for him; and that in the morning when the princess gave orders to harness for her journey, the peasants had come in a large crowd to the barn and sent word that they would not let her leave the village: that there was an order not to move, and that they would unharness the horses.</p>",
  "page-541": "<p> Alpátych had gone out to admonish them, but was told (it was chiefly Karp who did the talking, Dron not showing himself in the crowd) that they could not let the princess go, that there was an order to the contrary, but that if she stayed they would serve her as before and obey her in everything.</p><p>At the moment when Rostóv and Ilyín were galloping along the road, Princess Mary, despite the dissuasions of Alpátych, her nurse, and the maids, had given orders to harness and intended to start, but when the cavalrymen were espied they were taken for Frenchmen, the coachman ran away, and the women in the house began to wail.</p>",
  "page-542": "<p>&ldquo;Father! Benefactor! God has sent you!&rdquo; exclaimed deeply moved voices as Rostóv passed through the anteroom.</p><p>Princess Mary was sitting helpless and bewildered in the large sitting room, when Rostóv was shown in. She could not grasp who he was and why he had come, or what was happening to her. When she saw his Russian face, and by his walk and the first words he uttered recognized him as a man of her own class, she glanced at him with her deep radiant look and began speaking in a voice that faltered and trembled with emotion. This meeting immediately struck Rostóv as a romantic event. &ldquo;A helpless girl overwhelmed with grief, left to the mercy of coarse, rioting peasants! And what a strange fate sent me here! What gentleness and nobility there are in her features and expression!&rdquo; thought he as he looked at her and listened to her timid story.</p>",
  "page-543": "<p>When she began to tell him that all this had happened the day after her father&rsquo;s funeral, her voice trembled. She turned away, and then, as if fearing he might take her words as meant to move him to pity, looked at him with an apprehensive glance of inquiry. There were tears in Rostóv&rsquo;s eyes. Princess Mary noticed this and glanced gratefully at him with that radiant look which caused the plainness of her face to be forgotten.</p><p>&ldquo;I cannot express, Princess, how glad I am that I happened to ride here and am able to show my readiness to serve you,&rdquo; said Rostóv, rising. &ldquo;Go when you please, and I give you my word of honor that no one shall dare to cause you annoyance if only you will allow me to act as your escort.&rdquo; And bowing respectfully, as if to a lady of royal blood, he moved toward the door.</p>",
  "page-544": "<p>Rostóv&rsquo;s deferential tone seemed to indicate that though he would consider himself happy to be acquainted with her, he did not wish to take advantage of her misfortunes to intrude upon her.</p><p>Princess Mary understood this and appreciated his delicacy.</p><p>&ldquo;I am very, very grateful to you,&rdquo; she said in French, &ldquo;but I hope it was all a misunderstanding and that no one is to blame for it.&rdquo; She suddenly began to cry.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me!&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Rostóv, knitting his brows, left the room with another low bow.</p>",
  "page-545": "<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>",
  "page-546": "<p>&ldquo;Well, is she pretty? Ah, friend&mdash;my pink one is delicious; her name is Dunyásha....&rdquo;</p><p>But on glancing at Rostóv&rsquo;s face Ilyín stopped short. He saw that his hero and commander was following quite a different train of thought.</p><p>Rostóv glanced angrily at Ilyín and without replying strode off with rapid steps to the village.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show them; I&rsquo;ll give it to them, the brigands!&rdquo; said he to himself.</p><p>Alpátych at a gliding trot, only just managing not to run, kept up with him with difficulty.</p>",
  "page-547": "<p>&ldquo;What decision have you been pleased to come to?&rdquo; said he.</p><p>Rostóv stopped and, clenching his fists, suddenly and sternly turned on Alpátych.</p><p>&ldquo;Decision? What decision? Old dotard!...&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;What have you been about? Eh? The peasants are rioting, and you can&rsquo;t manage them? You&rsquo;re a traitor yourself! I know you. I&rsquo;ll flay you all alive!...&rdquo; And as if afraid of wasting his store of anger, he left Alpátych and went rapidly forward. Alpátych, mastering his offended feelings, kept pace with Rostóv at a gliding gait and continued to impart his views. He said the peasants were obdurate and that at the present moment it would be imprudent to &ldquo;overresist&rdquo; them without an armed force, and would it not be better first to send for the military?</p>",
  "page-548": "<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give them armed force... I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;overresist&rsquo; them!&rdquo; uttered Rostóv meaninglessly, breathless with irrational animal fury and the need to vent it.</p><p>Without considering what he would do he moved unconciously with quick, resolute steps toward the crowd. And the nearer he drew to it the more Alpátych felt that this unreasonable action might produce good results. The peasants in the crowd were similarly impressed when they saw Rostóv&rsquo;s rapid, firm steps and resolute, frowning face.</p><p>After the hussars had come to the village and Rostóv had gone to see the princess, a certain confusion and dissension had arisen among the crowd. Some of the peasants said that these new arrivals were Russians and might take it amiss that the mistress was being detained. Dron was of this opinion, but as soon as he expressed it Karp and others attacked their ex-Elder.</p>",
  "page-549": "<p>&ldquo;How many years have you been fattening on the commune?&rdquo; Karp shouted at him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all one to you! You&rsquo;ll dig up your pot of money and take it away with you.... What does it matter to you whether our homes are ruined or not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been told to keep order, and that no one is to leave their homes or take away a single grain, and that&rsquo;s all about it!&rdquo; cried another.</p><p>&ldquo;It was your son&rsquo;s turn to be conscripted, but no fear! You begrudged your lump of a son,&rdquo; a little old man suddenly began attacking Dron&mdash;&ldquo;and so they took my Vánka to be shaved for a soldier! But we all have to die.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-550": "<p>&ldquo;To be sure, we all have to die. I&rsquo;m not against the commune,&rdquo; said Dron.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it&mdash;not against it! You&rsquo;ve filled your belly....&rdquo;</p><p>The two tall peasants had their say. As soon as Rostóv, followed by Ilyín, Lavrúshka, and Alpátych, came up to the crowd, Karp, thrusting his fingers into his belt and smiling a little, walked to the front. Dron on the contrary retired to the rear and the crowd drew closer together.</p><p>&ldquo;Who is your Elder here? Hey?&rdquo; shouted Rostóv, coming up to the crowd with quick steps.</p>",
  "page-551": "<p>&ldquo;The Elder? What do you want with him?...&rdquo; asked Karp.</p><p>But before the words were well out of his mouth, his cap flew off and a fierce blow jerked his head to one side.</p><p>&ldquo;Caps off, traitors!&rdquo; shouted Rostóv in a wrathful voice. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the Elder?&rdquo; he cried furiously.</p><p>&ldquo;The Elder.... He wants the Elder!... Dron Zakhárych, you!&rdquo; meek and flustered voices here and there were heard calling and caps began to come off their heads.</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t riot, we&rsquo;re following the orders,&rdquo; declared Karp, and at that moment several voices began speaking together.</p>",
  "page-552": "<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as the old men have decided&mdash;there&rsquo;s too many of you giving orders.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Arguing? Mutiny!... Brigands! Traitors!&rdquo; cried Rostóv unmeaningly in a voice not his own, gripping Karp by the collar. &ldquo;Bind him, bind him!&rdquo; he shouted, though there was no one to bind him but Lavrúshka and Alpátych.</p><p>Lavrúshka, however, ran up to Karp and seized him by the arms from behind.</p><p>&ldquo;Shall I call up our men from beyond the hill?&rdquo; he called out.</p><p>Alpátych turned to the peasants and ordered two of them by name to come and bind Karp. The men obediently came out of the crowd and began taking off their belts.</p>",
  "page-553": "<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the Elder?&rdquo; demanded Rostóv in a loud voice.</p><p>With a pale and frowning face Dron stepped out of the crowd.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you the Elder? Bind him, Lavrúshka!&rdquo; shouted Rostóv, as if that order, too, could not possibly meet with any opposition.</p><p>And in fact two more peasants began binding Dron, who took off his own belt and handed it to them, as if to aid them.</p><p>&ldquo;And you all listen to me!&rdquo; said Rostóv to the peasants. &ldquo;Be off to your houses at once, and don&rsquo;t let one of your voices be heard!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-554": "<p>&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;ve not done any harm! We did it just out of foolishness. It&rsquo;s all nonsense.... I said then that it was not in order,&rdquo; voices were heard bickering with one another.</p><p>&ldquo;There! What did I say?&rdquo; said Alpátych, coming into his own again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wrong, lads!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All our stupidity, Yákov Alpátych,&rdquo; came the answers, and the crowd began at once to disperse through the village.</p><p>The two bound men were led off to the master&rsquo;s house. The two drunken peasants followed them.</p><p>&ldquo;Aye, when I look at you!...&rdquo; said one of them to Karp.</p>",
  "page-555": "<p>&ldquo;How can one talk to the masters like that? What were you thinking of, you fool?&rdquo; added the other&mdash;&ldquo;A real fool!&rdquo;</p><p>Two hours later the carts were standing in the courtyard of the Boguchárovo house. The peasants were briskly carrying out the proprietor&rsquo;s goods and packing them on the carts, and Dron, liberated at Princess Mary&rsquo;s wish from the cupboard where he had been confined, was standing in the yard directing the men.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put it in so carelessly,&rdquo; said one of the peasants, a man with a round smiling face, taking a casket from a housemaid. &ldquo;You know it has cost money! How can you chuck it in like that or shove it under the cord where it&rsquo;ll get rubbed? I don&rsquo;t like that way of doing things. Let it all be done properly, according to rule.</p>",
  "page-556": "<p> Look here, put it under the bast matting and cover it with hay&mdash;that&rsquo;s the way!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eh, books, books!&rdquo; said another peasant, bringing out Prince Andrew&rsquo;s library cupboards. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t catch up against it! It&rsquo;s heavy, lads&mdash;solid books.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, they worked all day and didn&rsquo;t play!&rdquo; remarked the tall, round-faced peasant gravely, pointing with a significant wink at the dictionaries that were on the top.</p><p>Unwilling to obtrude himself on the princess, Rostóv did not go back to the house but remained in the village awaiting her departure. When her carriage drove out of the house, he mounted and accompanied her eight miles from Boguchárovo to where the road was occupied by our troops. At the inn at Yankóvo he respectfully took leave of her, for the first time permitting himself to kiss her hand.</p>",
  "page-557": "<p>&ldquo;How can you speak so!&rdquo; he blushingly replied to Princess Mary&rsquo;s expressions of gratitude for her deliverance, as she termed what had occurred. &ldquo;Any police officer would have done as much! If we had had only peasants to fight, we should not have let the enemy come so far,&rdquo; said he with a sense of shame and wishing to change the subject. &ldquo;I am only happy to have had the opportunity of making your acquaintance. Good-by, Princess. I wish you happiness and consolation and hope to meet you again in happier circumstances. If you don&rsquo;t want to make me blush, please don&rsquo;t thank me!&rdquo;</p><p>But the princess, if she did not again thank him in words, thanked him with the whole expression of her face, radiant with gratitude and tenderness. She could not believe that there was nothing to thank him for.</p>",
  "page-558": "<p> On the contrary, it seemed to her certain that had he not been there she would have perished at the hands of the mutineers and of the French, and that he had exposed himself to terrible and obvious danger to save her, and even more certain was it that he was a man of lofty and noble soul, able to understand her position and her sorrow. His kind, honest eyes, with the tears rising in them when she herself had begun to cry as she spoke of her loss, did not leave her memory.</p><p>When she had taken leave of him and remained alone she suddenly felt her eyes filling with tears, and then not for the first time the strange question presented itself to her: did she love him?</p>",
  "page-559": "<p>On the rest of the way to Moscow, though the princess&rsquo; position was not a cheerful one, Dunyásha, who went with her in the carriage, more than once noticed that her mistress leaned out of the window and smiled at something with an expression of mingled joy and sorrow.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, supposing I do love him?&rdquo; thought Princess Mary.</p><p>Ashamed as she was of acknowledging to herself that she had fallen in love with a man who would perhaps never love her, she comforted herself with the thought that no one would ever know it and that she would not be to blame if, without ever speaking of it to anyone, she continued to the end of her life to love the man with whom she had fallen in love for the first and last time in her life.</p>",
  "page-560": "<p>Sometimes when she recalled his looks, his sympathy, and his words, happiness did not appear impossible to her. It was at those moments that Dunyásha noticed her smiling as she looked out of the carriage window.</p><p>&ldquo;Was it not fate that brought him to Boguchárovo, and at that very moment?&rdquo; thought Princess Mary. &ldquo;And that caused his sister to refuse my brother?&rdquo; And in all this Princess Mary saw the hand of Providence.</p><p>The impression the princess made on Rostóv was a very agreeable one. To remember her gave him pleasure, and when his comrades, hearing of his adventure at Boguchárovo, rallied him on having gone to look for hay and having picked up one of the wealthiest heiresses in Russia, he grew angry. It made him angry just because the idea of marrying the gentle Princess Mary, who was attractive to him and had an enormous fortune, had against his will more than once entered his head.</p>",
  "page-561": "<p> For himself personally Nicholas could not wish for a better wife: by marrying her he would make the countess his mother happy, would be able to put his father&rsquo;s affairs in order, and would even&mdash;he felt it&mdash;ensure Princess Mary&rsquo;s happiness.</p><p>But Sónya? And his plighted word? That was why Rostóv grew angry when he was rallied about Princess Bolkónskaya.</p>",
  "page-562": "<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>",
  "page-563": "<p>On receiving command of the armies Kutúzov remembered Prince Andrew and sent an order for him to report at headquarters.</p><p>Prince Andrew arrived at Tsárevo-Zaymíshche on the very day and at the very hour that Kutúzov was reviewing the troops for the first time. He stopped in the village at the priest&rsquo;s house in front of which stood the commander in chief&rsquo;s carriage, and he sat down on the bench at the gate awaiting his Serene Highness, as everyone now called Kutúzov. From the field beyond the village came now sounds of regimental music and now the roar of many voices shouting &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; to the new commander in chief. Two orderlies, a courier and a major-domo, stood near by, some ten paces from Prince Andrew, availing themselves of Kutúzov&rsquo;s absence and of the fine weather.</p>",
  "page-564": "<p> A short, swarthy lieutenant colonel of hussars with thick mustaches and whiskers rode up to the gate and, glancing at Prince Andrew, inquired whether his Serene Highness was putting up there and whether he would soon be back.</p><p>Prince Andrew replied that he was not on his Serene Highness&rsquo; staff but was himself a new arrival. The lieutenant colonel turned to a smart orderly, who, with the peculiar contempt with which a commander in chief&rsquo;s orderly speaks to officers, replied:</p><p>&ldquo;What? His Serene Highness? I expect he&rsquo;ll be here soon. What do you want?&rdquo;</p><p>The lieutenant colonel of hussars smiled beneath his mustache at the orderly&rsquo;s tone, dismounted, gave his horse to a dispatch runner, and approached Bolkónski with a slight bow. Bolkónski made room for him on the bench and the lieutenant colonel sat down beside him.</p>",
  "page-565": "<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re also waiting for the commander in chief?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;They say he weceives evewyone, thank God!... It&rsquo;s awful with those sausage eaters! Ermólov had weason to ask to be pwomoted to be a German! Now p&rsquo;waps Wussians will get a look in. As it was, devil only knows what was happening. We kept wetweating and wetweating. Did you take part in the campaign?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I had the pleasure,&rdquo; replied Prince Andrew, &ldquo;not only of taking part in the retreat but of losing in that retreat all I held dear&mdash;not to mention the estate and home of my birth&mdash;my father, who died of grief. I belong to the province of Smolénsk.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-566": "<p>&ldquo;Ah? You&rsquo;re Pwince Bolkónski? Vewy glad to make your acquaintance! I&rsquo;m Lieutenant Colonel Denísov, better known as &lsquo;Váska,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Denísov, pressing Prince Andrew&rsquo;s hand and looking into his face with a particularly kindly attention. &ldquo;Yes, I heard,&rdquo; said he sympathetically, and after a short pause added: &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s Scythian warfare. It&rsquo;s all vewy well&mdash;only not for those who get it in the neck. So you are Pwince Andwew Bolkónski?&rdquo; He swayed his head. &ldquo;Vewy pleased, Pwince, to make your acquaintance!&rdquo; he repeated again, smiling sadly, and he again pressed Prince Andrew&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>Prince Andrew knew Denísov from what Natásha had told him of her first suitor.</p>",
  "page-567": "<p> This memory carried him sadly and sweetly back to those painful feelings of which he had not thought lately, but which still found place in his soul. Of late he had received so many new and very serious impressions&mdash;such as the retreat from Smolénsk, his visit to Bald Hills, and the recent news of his father&rsquo;s death&mdash;and had experienced so many emotions, that for a long time past those memories had not entered his mind, and now that they did, they did not act on him with nearly their former strength. For Denísov, too, the memories awakened by the name of Bolkónski belonged to a distant, romantic past, when after supper and after Natásha&rsquo;s singing he had proposed to a little girl of fifteen without realizing what he was doing. He smiled at the recollection of that time and of his love for Natásha, and passed at once to what now interested him passionately and exclusively.</p>",
  "page-568": "<p> This was a plan of campaign he had devised while serving at the outposts during the retreat. He had proposed that plan to Barclay de Tolly and now wished to propose it to Kutúzov. The plan was based on the fact that the French line of operation was too extended, and it proposed that instead of, or concurrently with, action on the front to bar the advance of the French, we should attack their line of communication. He began explaining his plan to Prince Andrew.</p><p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t hold all that line. It&rsquo;s impossible. I will undertake to bweak thwough. Give me five hundwed men and I will bweak the line, that&rsquo;s certain! There&rsquo;s only one way&mdash;guewilla warfare!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-569": "<p>Denísov rose and began gesticulating as he explained his plan to Bolkónski. In the midst of his explanation shouts were heard from the army, growing more incoherent and more diffused, mingling with music and songs and coming from the field where the review was held. Sounds of hoofs and shouts were nearing the village.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming! He&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo; shouted a Cossack standing at the gate.</p><p>Bolkónski and Denísov moved to the gate, at which a knot of soldiers (a guard of honor) was standing, and they saw Kutúzov coming down the street mounted on a rather small sorrel horse. A huge suite of generals rode behind him. Barclay was riding almost beside him, and a crowd of officers ran after and around them shouting, &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-570": "<p>His adjutants galloped into the yard before him. Kutúzov was impatiently urging on his horse, which ambled smoothly under his weight, and he raised his hand to his white Horse Guard&rsquo;s cap with a red band and no peak, nodding his head continually. When he came up to the guard of honor, a fine set of Grenadiers mostly wearing decorations, who were giving him the salute, he looked at them silently and attentively for nearly a minute with the steady gaze of a commander and then turned to the crowd of generals and officers surrounding him. Suddenly his face assumed a subtle expression, he shrugged his shoulders with an air of perplexity.</p><p>&ldquo;And with such fine fellows to retreat and retreat! Well, good-by, General,&rdquo; he added, and rode into the yard past Prince Andrew and Denísov.</p>",
  "page-571": "<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!&rdquo; shouted those behind him.</p><p>Since Prince Andrew had last seen him Kutúzov had grown still more corpulent, flaccid, and fat. But the bleached eyeball, the scar, and the familiar weariness of his expression were still the same. He was wearing the white Horse Guard&rsquo;s cap and a military overcoat with a whip hanging over his shoulder by a thin strap. He sat heavily and swayed limply on his brisk little horse.</p><p>&ldquo;Whew... whew... whew!&rdquo; he whistled just audibly as he rode into the yard. His face expressed the relief of relaxed strain felt by a man who means to rest after a ceremony. He drew his left foot out of the stirrup and, lurching with his whole body and puckering his face with the effort, raised it with difficulty onto the saddle, leaned on his knee, groaned, and slipped down into the arms of the Cossacks and adjutants who stood ready to assist him.</p>",
  "page-572": "<p>He pulled himself together, looked round, screwing up his eyes, glanced at Prince Andrew, and, evidently not recognizing him, moved with his waddling gait to the porch. &ldquo;Whew... whew... whew!&rdquo; he whistled, and again glanced at Prince Andrew. As often occurs with old men, it was only after some seconds that the impression produced by Prince Andrew&rsquo;s face linked itself up with Kutúzov&rsquo;s remembrance of his personality.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, how do you do, my dear prince? How do you do, my dear boy? Come along...&rdquo; said he, glancing wearily round, and he stepped onto the porch which creaked under his weight.</p><p>He unbuttoned his coat and sat down on a bench in the porch.</p>",
  "page-573": "<p>&ldquo;And how&rsquo;s your father?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I received news of his death, yesterday,&rdquo; replied Prince Andrew abruptly.</p><p>Kutúzov looked at him with eyes wide open with dismay and then took off his cap and crossed himself:</p><p>&ldquo;May the kingdom of Heaven be his! God&rsquo;s will be done to us all!&rdquo; He sighed deeply, his whole chest heaving, and was silent for a while. &ldquo;I loved him and respected him, and sympathize with you with all my heart.&rdquo;</p><p>He embraced Prince Andrew, pressing him to his fat breast, and for some time did not let him go. When he released him Prince Andrew saw that Kutúzov&rsquo;s flabby lips were trembling and that tears were in his eyes. He sighed and pressed on the bench with both hands to raise himself.</p>",
  "page-574": "<p>&ldquo;Come! Come with me, we&rsquo;ll have a talk,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>But at that moment Denísov, no more intimidated by his superiors than by the enemy, came with jingling spurs up the steps of the porch, despite the angry whispers of the adjutants who tried to stop him. Kutúzov, his hands still pressed on the seat, glanced at him glumly. Denísov, having given his name, announced that he had to communicate to his Serene Highness a matter of great importance for their country&rsquo;s welfare. Kutúzov looked wearily at him and, lifting his hands with a gesture of annoyance, folded them across his stomach, repeating the words: &ldquo;For our country&rsquo;s welfare? Well, what is it? Speak!&rdquo; Denísov blushed like a girl (it was strange to see the color rise in that shaggy, bibulous, time-worn face) and boldly began to expound his plan of cutting the enemy&rsquo;</p>",
  "page-575": "<p>s lines of communication between Smolénsk and Vyázma. Denísov came from those parts and knew the country well. His plan seemed decidedly a good one, especially from the strength of conviction with which he spoke. Kutúzov looked down at his own legs, occasionally glancing at the door of the adjoining hut as if expecting something unpleasant to emerge from it. And from that hut, while Denísov was speaking, a general with a portfolio under his arm really did appear.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Kutúzov, in the midst of Denísov&rsquo;s explanations, &ldquo;are you ready so soon?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ready, your Serene Highness,&rdquo; replied the general.</p>",
  "page-576": "<p>Kutúzov swayed his head, as much as to say: &ldquo;How is one man to deal with it all?&rdquo; and again listened to Denísov.</p><p>&ldquo;I give my word of honor as a Wussian officer,&rdquo; said Denísov, &ldquo;that I can bweak Napoleon&rsquo;s line of communication!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What relation are you to Intendant General Kiríl Andréevich Denísov?&rdquo; asked Kutúzov, interrupting him.</p><p>&ldquo;He is my uncle, your Sewene Highness.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, we were friends,&rdquo; said Kutúzov cheerfully. &ldquo;All right, all right, friend, stay here at the staff and tomorrow we&rsquo;ll have a talk.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-577": "<p>With a nod to Denísov he turned away and put out his hand for the papers Konovnítsyn had brought him.</p><p>&ldquo;Would not your Serene Highness like to come inside?&rdquo; said the general on duty in a discontented voice, &ldquo;the plans must be examined and several papers have to be signed.&rdquo;</p><p>An adjutant came out and announced that everything was in readiness within. But Kutúzov evidently did not wish to enter that room till he was disengaged. He made a grimace....</p><p>&ldquo;No, tell them to bring a small table out here, my dear boy. I&rsquo;ll look at them here,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go away,&rdquo; he added, turning to Prince Andrew, who remained in the porch and listened to the general&rsquo;s report.</p>",
  "page-578": "<p>While this was being given, Prince Andrew heard the whisper of a woman&rsquo;s voice and the rustle of a silk dress behind the door. Several times on glancing that way he noticed behind that door a plump, rosy, handsome woman in a pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief on her head, holding a dish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the commander in chief. Kutúzov&rsquo;s adjutant whispered to Prince Andrew that this was the wife of the priest whose home it was, and that she intended to offer his Serene Highness bread and salt. &ldquo;Her husband has welcomed his Serene Highness with the cross at the church, and she intends to welcome him in the house.... She&rsquo;s very pretty,&rdquo; added the adjutant with a smile. At those words Kutúzov looked round.</p>",
  "page-579": "<p> He was listening to the general&rsquo;s report&mdash;which consisted chiefly of a criticism of the position at Tsárevo-Zaymíshche&mdash;as he had listened to Denísov, and seven years previously had listened to the discussion at the Austerlitz council of war. He evidently listened only because he had ears which, though there was a piece of tow in one of them, could not help hearing; but it was evident that nothing the general could say would surprise or even interest him, that he knew all that would be said beforehand, and heard it all only because he had to, as one has to listen to the chanting of a service of prayer. All that Denísov had said was clever and to the point. What the general was saying was even more clever and to the point, but it was evident that Kutúzov despised knowledge and cleverness, and knew of something else that would decide the matter&mdash;</p>",
  "page-580": "<p>something independent of cleverness and knowledge. Prince Andrew watched the commander in chief&rsquo;s face attentively, and the only expression he could see there was one of boredom, curiosity as to the meaning of the feminine whispering behind the door, and a desire to observe propriety. It was evident that Kutúzov despised cleverness and learning and even the patriotic feeling shown by Denísov, but despised them not because of his own intellect, feelings, or knowledge&mdash;he did not try to display any of these&mdash;but because of something else. He despised them because of his old age and experience of life. The only instruction Kutúzov gave of his own accord during that report referred to looting by the Russian troops. At the end of the report the general put before him for signature a paper relating to the recovery of payment from army commanders for green oats mown down by the soldiers, when landowners lodged petitions for compensation.</p>",
  "page-581": "<p>After hearing the matter, Kutúzov smacked his lips together and shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Into the stove... into the fire with it! I tell you once for all, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;into the fire with all such things! Let them cut the crops and burn wood to their hearts&rsquo; content. I don&rsquo;t order it or allow it, but I don&rsquo;t exact compensation either. One can&rsquo;t get on without it. &lsquo;When wood is chopped the chips will fly.&rsquo;&rdquo; He looked at the paper again. &ldquo;Oh, this German precision!&rdquo; he muttered, shaking his head.</p>",
  "page-582": "<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>",
  "page-583": "<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; said Kutúzov as he signed the last of the documents, and rising heavily and smoothing out the folds in his fat white neck he moved toward the door with a more cheerful expression.</p><p>The priest&rsquo;s wife, flushing rosy red, caught up the dish she had after all not managed to present at the right moment, though she had so long been preparing for it, and with a low bow offered it to Kutúzov.</p><p>He screwed up his eyes, smiled, lifted her chin with his hand, and said:</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, what a beauty! Thank you, sweetheart!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-584": "<p>He took some gold pieces from his trouser pocket and put them on the dish for her. &ldquo;Well, my dear, and how are we getting on?&rdquo; he asked, moving to the door of the room assigned to him. The priest&rsquo;s wife smiled, and with dimples in her rosy cheeks followed him into the room. The adjutant came out to the porch and asked Prince Andrew to lunch with him. Half an hour later Prince Andrew was again called to Kutúzov. He found him reclining in an armchair, still in the same unbuttoned overcoat. He had in his hand a French book which he closed as Prince Andrew entered, marking the place with a knife. Prince Andrew saw by the cover that it was Les Chevaliers du Cygne by Madame de Genlis.</p>",
  "page-585": "<p>&ldquo;Well, sit down, sit down here. Let&rsquo;s have a talk,&rdquo; said Kutúzov. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad, very sad. But remember, my dear fellow, that I am a father to you, a second father....&rdquo;</p><p>Prince Andrew told Kutúzov all he knew of his father&rsquo;s death, and what he had seen at Bald Hills when he passed through it.</p><p>&ldquo;What... what they have brought us to!&rdquo; Kutúzov suddenly cried in an agitated voice, evidently picturing vividly to himself from Prince Andrew&rsquo;s story the condition Russia was in. &ldquo;But give me time, give me time!&rdquo; he said with a grim look, evidently not wishing to continue this agitating conversation, and added: &ldquo;I sent for you to keep you with me.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-586": "<p>&ldquo;I thank your Serene Highness, but I fear I am no longer fit for the staff,&rdquo; replied Prince Andrew with a smile which Kutúzov noticed.</p><p>Kutúzov glanced inquiringly at him.</p><p>&ldquo;But above all,&rdquo; added Prince Andrew, &ldquo;I have grown used to my regiment, am fond of the officers, and I fancy the men also like me. I should be sorry to leave the regiment. If I decline the honor of being with you, believe me...&rdquo;</p><p>A shrewd, kindly, yet subtly derisive expression lit up Kutúzov&rsquo;s podgy face. He cut Bolkónski short.</p>",
  "page-587": "<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, for I need you. But you&rsquo;re right, you&rsquo;re right! It&rsquo;s not here that men are needed. Advisers are always plentiful, but men are not. The regiments would not be what they are if the would-be advisers served there as you do. I remember you at Austerlitz.... I remember, yes, I remember you with the standard!&rdquo; said Kutúzov, and a flush of pleasure suffused Prince Andrew&rsquo;s face at this recollection.</p><p>Taking his hand and drawing him downwards, Kutúzov offered his cheek to be kissed, and again Prince Andrew noticed tears in the old man&rsquo;s eyes. Though Prince Andrew knew that Kutúzov&rsquo;s tears came easily, and that he was particularly tender to and considerate of him from a wish to show sympathy with his loss, yet this reminder of Austerlitz was both pleasant and flattering to him.</p>",
  "page-588": "<p>&ldquo;Go your way and God be with you. I know your path is the path of honor!&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;I missed you at Bucharest, but I needed someone to send.&rdquo; And changing the subject, Kutúzov began to speak of the Turkish war and the peace that had been concluded. &ldquo;Yes, I have been much blamed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;both for that war and the peace... but everything came at the right time. Tout vient à point à celui qui sait attendre. * And there were as many advisers there as here...&rdquo; he went on, returning to the subject of &ldquo;advisers&rdquo; which evidently occupied him. &ldquo;Ah, those advisers!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If we had listened to them all we should not have made peace with Turkey and should not have been through with that war. Everything in haste, but more haste, less speed. Kámenski would have been lost if he had not died. He stormed fortresses with thirty thousand men.</p>",
  "page-589": "<p> It is not difficult to capture a fortress but it is difficult to win a campaign. For that, not storming and attacking but patience and time are wanted. Kámenski sent soldiers to Rustchuk, but I only employed these two things and took more fortresses than Kámenski and made them Turks eat horseflesh!&rdquo; He swayed his head. &ldquo;And the French shall too, believe me,&rdquo; he went on, growing warmer and beating his chest, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make them eat horseflesh!&rdquo; And tears again dimmed his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;But shan&rsquo;t we have to accept battle?&rdquo; remarked Prince Andrew.</p><p>&ldquo;We shall if everybody wants it; it can&rsquo;t be helped....

Dans le doute, mon cher,&rdquo; he paused, &ldquo;abstiens-toi&rdquo; *(2)&mdash;he articulated the French proverb deliberately.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, good-by, my dear fellow; remember that with all my heart I share your sorrow, and that for you I am not a Serene Highness, nor a prince, nor a commander in chief, but a father!

The more he realized the absence of all personal motive in that old man&mdash;in whom there seemed to remain only the habit of passions, and in place of an intellect (grouping events and drawing conclusions) only the capacity calmly to contemplate the course of events&mdash;the more reassured he was that everything would be as it should. &ldquo;He will not bring in any plan of his own.</p>",
  "page-592": "<p> He will not devise or undertake anything,&rdquo; thought Prince Andrew, &ldquo;but he will hear everything, remember everything, and put everything in its place. He will not hinder anything useful nor allow anything harmful. He understands that there is something stronger and more important than his own will&mdash;the inevitable course of events, and he can see them and grasp their significance, and seeing that significance can refrain from meddling and renounce his personal wish directed to something else. And above all,&rdquo; thought Prince Andrew, &ldquo;one believes in him because he&rsquo;s Russian, despite the novel by Genlis and the French proverbs, and because his voice shook when he said: &lsquo;What they have brought us to!&rsquo; and had a sob in it when he said he would &lsquo;make them eat horseflesh!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-593": "<p>On such feelings, more or less dimly shared by all, the unanimity and general approval were founded with which, despite court influences, the popular choice of Kutúzov as commander in chief was received.</p>",

  "page-595": "<p>After the Emperor had left Moscow, life flowed on there in its usual course, and its course was so very usual that it was difficult to remember the recent days of patriotic elation and ardor, hard to believe that Russia was really in danger and that the members of the English Club were also sons of the Fatherland ready to sacrifice everything for it. The one thing that recalled the patriotic fervor everyone had displayed during the Emperor&rsquo;s stay was the call for contributions of men and money, a necessity that as soon as the promises had been made assumed a legal, official form and became unavoidable.</p><p>With the enemy&rsquo;s approach to Moscow, the Moscovites&rsquo; view of their situation did not grow more serious but on the contrary became even more frivolous, as always happens with people who see a great danger approaching.</p>",
  "page-596": "<p> At the approach of danger there are always two voices that speak with equal power in the human soul: one very reasonably tells a man to consider the nature of the danger and the means of escaping it; the other, still more reasonably, says that it is too depressing and painful to think of the danger, since it is not in man&rsquo;s power to foresee everything and avert the general course of events, and it is therefore better to disregard what is painful till it comes, and to think about what is pleasant. In solitude a man generally listens to the first voice, but in society to the second. So it was now with the inhabitants of Moscow. It was long since people had been as gay in Moscow as that year.</p><p>Rostopchín&rsquo;s broadsheets, headed by woodcuts of a drink shop, a potman, and a Moscow burgher called Karpúshka Chigírin, &ldquo;who&mdash;having been</p>",

They are all dwarfs and one peasant woman will toss three of them with a hayfork.&rdquo; Others did not like that tone and said it was stupid and vulgar.</p>",
  "page-598": "<p> It was said that Rostopchín had expelled all Frenchmen and even all foreigners from Moscow, and that there had been some spies and agents of Napoleon among them; but this was told chiefly to introduce Rostopchín&rsquo;s witty remark on that occasion. The foreigners were deported to Nízhni by boat, and Rostopchín had said to them in French: &ldquo;Rentrez en vous-mêmes; entrez dans la barque, et n&rsquo;en faites pas une barque de Charon.&rdquo; * There was talk of all the government offices having been already removed from Moscow, and to this Shinshín&rsquo;s witticism was added&mdash;that for that alone Moscow ought to be grateful to Napoleon.

What pleasure is there to be so caustique?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A forfeit!&rdquo; cried a young man in militia uniform whom Julie called &ldquo;mon chevalier,&rdquo; and who was going with her to Nízhni.</p>",
  "page-600": "<p>In Julie&rsquo;s set, as in many other circles in Moscow, it had been agreed that they would speak nothing but Russian and that those who made a slip and spoke French should pay fines to the Committee of Voluntary Contributions.</p><p>&ldquo;Another forfeit for a Gallicism,&rdquo; said a Russian writer who was present. &ldquo;&lsquo;What pleasure is there to be&rsquo; is not Russian!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You spare no one,&rdquo; continued Julie to the young man without heeding the author&rsquo;s remark.</p><p>&ldquo;For caustique&mdash;I am guilty and will pay, and I am prepared to pay again for the pleasure of telling you the truth. For Gallicisms I won&rsquo;t be responsible,&rdquo; she remarked, turning to the author: &ldquo;I have neither the money nor the time, like Prince Galítsyn, to engage a master to teach me Russian!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-601": "<p>&ldquo;Ah, here he is!&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Quand on... No, no,&rdquo; she said to the militia officer, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t catch me. Speak of the sun and you see its rays!&rdquo; and she smiled amiably at Pierre. &ldquo;We were just talking of you,&rdquo; she said with the facility in lying natural to a society woman. &ldquo;We were saying that your regiment would be sure to be better than Mamónov&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t talk to me of my regiment,&rdquo; replied Pierre, kissing his hostess&rsquo; hand and taking a seat beside her. &ldquo;I am so sick of it.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-602": "<p>&ldquo;You will, of course, command it yourself?&rdquo; said Julie, directing a sly, sarcastic glance toward the militia officer.</p><p>The latter in Pierre&rsquo;s presence had ceased to be caustic, and his face expressed perplexity as to what Julie&rsquo;s smile might mean. In spite of his absent-mindedness and good nature, Pierre&rsquo;s personality immediately checked any attempt to ridicule him to his face.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Pierre, with a laughing glance at his big, stout body. &ldquo;I should make too good a target for the French, besides I am afraid I should hardly be able to climb onto a horse.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-603": "<p>Among those whom Julie&rsquo;s guests happened to choose to gossip about were the Rostóvs.</p><p>&ldquo;I hear that their affairs are in a very bad way,&rdquo; said Julie. &ldquo;And he is so unreasonable, the count himself I mean.

  "page-604": "<p>&ldquo;Then why are you leaving?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I? What a question!

And why do they stay on so long in Moscow? They meant to leave for the country long ago. Natalie is quite well again now, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; Julie asked Pierre with a knowing smile.</p>",
  "page-605": "<p>&ldquo;They are waiting for their younger son,&rdquo; Pierre replied. &ldquo;He joined Obolénski&rsquo;s Cossacks and went to Bélaya Tsérkov where the regiment is being formed. But now they have had him transferred to my regiment and are expecting him every day. The count wanted to leave long ago, but the countess won&rsquo;t on any account leave Moscow till her son returns.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I met them the day before yesterday at the Arkhárovs&rsquo;.

  "page-606": "<p>Julie smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, Count, such knights as you are only found in Madame de Souza&rsquo;s novels.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What knights?

  "page-607": "<p>&ldquo;Come now, Count, you know!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about it,&rdquo; said Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;I know you were friendly with Natalie, and so... but I was always more friendly with Véra&mdash;that dear Véra.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, madame!&rdquo; Pierre continued in a tone of displeasure, &ldquo;I have not taken on myself the role of Natalie Rostóva&rsquo;s knight at all, and have not been to their house for nearly a month. But I cannot understand the cruelty...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Qui s&rsquo;excuse s&rsquo;accuse,&rdquo; * said Julie, smiling and waving the lint triumphantly, and to have the last word she promptly changed the subject.</p>",
  "page-608": "<p> &ldquo;Do you know what I heard today? Poor Mary Bolkónskaya arrived in Moscow yesterday. Do you know that she has lost her father?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really? Where is she?

She is going to their estate near Moscow either today or tomorrow morning, with her nephew.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, and how is she?&rdquo; asked Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;She is well, but sad. But do you know who rescued her? It is quite a romance. Nicholas Rostóv! She was surrounded, and they wanted to kill her and had wounded some of her people. He rushed in and saved her....&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-609": "<p>&ldquo;Another romance,&rdquo; said the militia officer. &ldquo;Really, this general flight has been arranged to get all the old maids married off.

  "page-610": "<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>",
  "page-611": "<p>When Pierre returned home he was handed two of Rostopchín&rsquo;s broadsheets that had been brought that day.</p><p>The first declared that the report that Count Rostopchín had forbidden people to leave Moscow was false; on the contrary he was glad that ladies and tradesmen&rsquo;s wives were leaving the city. &ldquo;There will be less panic and less gossip,&rdquo; ran the broadsheet &ldquo;but I will stake my life on it that that scoundrel will not enter Moscow.&rdquo; These words showed Pierre clearly for the first time that the French would enter Moscow. The second broadsheet stated that our headquarters were at Vyázma, that Count Wittgenstein had defeated the French, but that as many of the inhabitants of Moscow wished to be armed, weapons were ready for them at the arsenal: sabers, pistols, and muskets which could be had at a low price.</p>",
  "page-612": "<p> The tone of the proclamation was not as jocose as in the former Chigírin talks. Pierre pondered over these broadsheets. Evidently the terrible stormcloud he had desired with the whole strength of his soul but which yet aroused involuntary horror in him was drawing near.</p><p>&ldquo;Shall I join the army and enter the service, or wait?&rdquo; he asked himself for the hundredth time. He took a pack of cards that lay on the table and began to lay them out for a game of patience.</p><p>&ldquo;If this patience comes out,&rdquo; he said to himself after shuffling the cards, holding them in his hand, and lifting his head, &ldquo;if it comes out, it means... what does it mean?&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-613": "<p>He had not decided what it should mean when he heard the voice of the eldest princess at the door asking whether she might come in.</p><p>&ldquo;Then it will mean that I must go to the army,&rdquo; said Pierre to himself. &ldquo;Come in, come in!&rdquo; he added to the princess.</p><p>Only the eldest princess, the one with the stony face and long waist, was still living in Pierre&rsquo;s house. The two younger ones had both married.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse my coming to you, cousin,&rdquo; she said in a reproachful and agitated voice. &ldquo;You know some decision must be come to. What is going to happen? Everyone has left Moscow and the people are rioting. How is it that we are staying on?&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-614": "<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, things seem satisfactory, ma cousine,&rdquo; said Pierre in the bantering tone he habitually adopted toward her, always feeling uncomfortable in the role of her benefactor.</p><p>&ldquo;Satisfactory, indeed! Very satisfactory! Barbara Ivánovna told me today how our troops are distinguishing themselves. It certainly does them credit! And the people too are quite mutinous&mdash;they no longer obey, even my maid has taken to being rude. At this rate they will soon begin beating us. One can&rsquo;t walk in the streets. But, above all, the French will be here any day now, so what are we waiting for? I ask just one thing of you, cousin,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;arrange for me to be taken to Petersburg. Whatever I may be, I can&rsquo;t live under Bonaparte&rsquo;s rule.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-615": "<p>&ldquo;Oh, come, ma cousine! Where do you get your information from? On the contrary...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t submit to your Napoleon! Others may if they please.... If you don&rsquo;t want to do this...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I will, I&rsquo;ll give the order at once.&rdquo;</p><p>The princess was apparently vexed at not having anyone to be angry with. Muttering to herself, she sat down on a chair.</p><p>&ldquo;But you have been misinformed,&rdquo; said Pierre. &ldquo;Everything is quiet in the city and there is not the slightest danger. See! I&rsquo;ve just been reading...&rdquo; He showed her the broadsheet. &ldquo;Count Rostopchín writes that he will stake his life on it that the enemy will not enter Moscow.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-616": "<p>&ldquo;Oh, that count of yours!&rdquo; said the princess malevolently. &ldquo;He is a hypocrite, a rascal who has himself roused the people to riot. Didn&rsquo;t he write in those idiotic broadsheets that anyone, &lsquo;whoever it might be, should be dragged to the lockup by his hair&rsquo;? (How silly!) &lsquo;And honor and glory to whoever captures him,&rsquo; he says. This is what his cajolery has brought us to! Barbara Ivánovna told me the mob near killed her because she said something in French.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, but it&rsquo;s so... You take everything so to heart,&rdquo; said Pierre, and began laying out his cards for patience.</p><p>Although that patience did come out, Pierre did not join the army, but remained in deserted Moscow ever in the same state of agitation, irresolution, and alarm, yet at the same time joyfully expecting something terrible.</p>",
  "page-617": "<p>Next day toward evening the princess set off, and Pierre&rsquo;s head steward came to inform him that the money needed for the equipment of his regiment could not be found without selling one of the estates. In general the head steward made out to Pierre that his project of raising a regiment would ruin him. Pierre listened to him, scarcely able to repress a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Well then, sell it,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done? I can&rsquo;t draw back now!&rdquo;</p><p>The worse everything became, especially his own affairs, the better was Pierre pleased and the more evident was it that the catastrophe he expected was approaching. Hardly anyone he knew was left in town. Julie had gone, and so had Princess Mary. Of his intimate friends only the Rostóvs remained, but he did not go to see them.</p>",
  "page-618": "<p>To distract his thoughts he drove that day to the village of Vorontsóvo to see the great balloon Leppich was constructing to destroy the foe, and a trial balloon that was to go up next day. The balloon was not yet ready, but Pierre learned that it was being constructed by the Emperor&rsquo;s desire. The Emperor had written to Count Rostopchín as follows:</p><p>As soon as Leppich is ready, get together a crew of reliable and intelligent men for his car and send a courier to General Kutúzov to let him know. I have informed him of the matter.</p><p>Please impress upon Leppich to be very careful where he descends for the first time, that he may not make a mistake and fall into the enemy&rsquo;s hands. It is essential for him to combine his movements with those of the commander in chief.</p>",
  "page-619": "<p>On his way home from Vorontsóvo, as he was passing the Bolótnoe Place Pierre, seeing a large crowd round the Lóbnoe Place, stopped and got out of his trap. A French cook accused of being a spy was being flogged. The flogging was only just over, and the executioner was releasing from the flogging bench a stout man with red whiskers, in blue stockings and a green jacket, who was moaning piteously. Another criminal, thin and pale, stood near. Judging by their faces they were both Frenchmen. With a frightened and suffering look resembling that on the thin Frenchman&rsquo;s face, Pierre pushed his way in through the crowd.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it? Who is it? What is it for?&rdquo; he kept asking.</p>",
  "page-620": "<p>But the attention of the crowd&mdash;officials, burghers, shopkeepers, peasants, and women in cloaks and in pelisses&mdash;was so eagerly centered on what was passing in Lóbnoe Place that no one answered him. The stout man rose, frowned, shrugged his shoulders, and evidently trying to appear firm began to pull on his jacket without looking about him, but suddenly his lips trembled and he began to cry, in the way full-blooded grown-up men cry, though angry with himself for doing so. In the crowd people began talking loudly, to stifle their feelings of pity as it seemed to Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s cook to some prince.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eh, mounseer, Russian sauce seems to be sour to a Frenchman... sets his teeth on edge!&rdquo; said a wrinkled clerk who was standing behind Pierre, when the Frenchman began to cry.</p>",
  "page-621": "<p>The clerk glanced round, evidently hoping that his joke would be appreciated. Some people began to laugh, others continued to watch in dismay the executioner who was undressing the other man.</p><p>Pierre choked, his face puckered, and he turned hastily away, went back to his trap muttering something to himself as he went, and took his seat. As they drove along he shuddered and exclaimed several times so audibly that the coachman asked him:</p><p>&ldquo;What is your pleasure?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; shouted Pierre to the man, who was driving to Lubyánka Street.</p><p>&ldquo;To the Governor&rsquo;s, as you ordered,&rdquo; answered the coachman.</p>",
  "page-622": "<p>&ldquo;Fool! Idiot!&rdquo; shouted Pierre, abusing his coachman&mdash;a thing he rarely did. &ldquo;Home, I told you! And drive faster, blockhead!&rdquo; &ldquo;I must get away this very day,&rdquo; he murmured to himself.</p><p>At the sight of the tortured Frenchman and the crowd surrounding the Lóbnoe Place, Pierre had so definitely made up his mind that he could no longer remain in Moscow and would leave for the army that very day that it seemed to him that either he had told the coachman this or that the man ought to have known it for himself.</p><p>On reaching home Pierre gave orders to Evstáfey&mdash;his head coachman who knew everything, could do anything, and was known to all Moscow&mdash;that he would leave that night for the army at Mozháysk, and that his saddle horses should be sent there.</p>",
  "page-623": "<p> This could not all be arranged that day, so on Evstáfey&rsquo;s representation Pierre had to put off his departure till next day to allow time for the relay horses to be sent on in advance.</p><p>On the twenty-fourth the weather cleared up after a spell of rain, and after dinner Pierre left Moscow. When changing horses that night in Perkhúshkovo, he learned that there had been a great battle that evening. (This was the battle of Shevárdino.) He was told that there in Perkhúshkovo the earth trembled from the firing, but nobody could answer his questions as to who had won. At dawn next day Pierre was approaching Mozháysk.</p><p>Every house in Mozháysk had soldiers quartered in it, and at the hostel where Pierre was met by his groom and coachman there was no room to be had. It was full of officers.</p>",
  "page-624": "<p>Everywhere in Mozháysk and beyond it, troops were stationed or on the march. Cossacks, foot and horse soldiers, wagons, caissons, and cannon were everywhere. Pierre pushed forward as fast as he could, and the farther he left Moscow behind and the deeper he plunged into that sea of troops the more was he overcome by restless agitation and a new and joyful feeling he had not experienced before. It was a feeling akin to what he had felt at the Slobóda Palace during the Emperor&rsquo;s visit&mdash;a sense of the necessity of undertaking something and sacrificing something. He now experienced a glad consciousness that everything that constitutes men&rsquo;s happiness&mdash;the comforts of life, wealth, even life itself&mdash;is rubbish it is pleasant to throw away, compared with something...</p>",
  "page-625": "<p> With what? Pierre could not say, and he did not try to determine for whom and for what he felt such particular delight in sacrificing everything. He was not occupied with the question of what to sacrifice for; the fact of sacrificing in itself afforded him a new and joyous sensation.</p>",
  "page-626": "<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>",
  "page-627": "<p>On the twenty-fourth of August the battle of the Shevárdino Redoubt was fought, on the twenty-fifth not a shot was fired by either side, and on the twenty-sixth the battle of Borodinó itself took place.</p><p>Why and how were the battles of Shevárdino and Borodinó given and accepted? Why was the battle of Borodinó fought? There was not the least sense in it for either the French or the Russians. Its immediate result for the Russians was, and was bound to be, that we were brought nearer to the destruction of Moscow&mdash;which we feared more than anything in the world; and for the French its immediate result was that they were brought nearer to the destruction of their whole army&mdash;which they feared more than anything in the world. What the result must be was quite obvious, and yet Napoleon offered and Kutúzov accepted that battle.</p>",
  "page-628": "<p>If the commanders had been guided by reason, it would seem that it must have been obvious to Napoleon that by advancing thirteen hundred miles and giving battle with a probability of losing a quarter of his army, he was advancing to certain destruction, and it must have been equally clear to Kutúzov that by accepting battle and risking the loss of a quarter of his army he would certainly lose Moscow. For Kutúzov this was mathematically clear, as it is that if when playing draughts I have one man less and go on exchanging, I shall certainly lose, and therefore should not exchange. When my opponent has sixteen men and I have fourteen, I am only one eighth weaker than he, but when I have exchanged thirteen more men he will be three times as strong as I am.</p>",
  "page-629": "<p>Before the battle of Borodinó our strength in proportion to the French was about as five to six, but after that battle it was little more than one to two: previously we had a hundred thousand against a hundred and twenty thousand; afterwards little more than fifty thousand against a hundred thousand. Yet the shrewd and experienced Kutúzov accepted the battle, while Napoleon, who was said to be a commander of genius, gave it, losing a quarter of his army and lengthening his lines of communication still more. If it is said that he expected to end the campaign by occupying Moscow as he had ended a previous campaign by occupying Vienna, there is much evidence to the contrary. Napoleon&rsquo;</p>",
  "page-630": "<p>s historians themselves tell us that from Smolénsk onwards he wished to stop, knew the danger of his extended position, and knew that the occupation of Moscow would not be the end of the campaign, for he had seen at Smolénsk the state in which Russian towns were left to him, and had not received a single reply to his repeated announcements of his wish to negotiate.</p><p>In giving and accepting battle at Borodinó, Kutúzov acted involuntarily and irrationally. But later on, to fit what had occurred, the historians provided cunningly devised evidence of the foresight and genius of the generals who, of all the blind tools of history were the most enslaved and involuntary.</p>",
  "page-631": "<p>The ancients have left us model heroic poems in which the heroes furnish the whole interest of the story, and we are still unable to accustom ourselves to the fact that for our epoch histories of that kind are meaningless.</p><p>On the other question, how the battle of Borodinó and the preceding battle of Shevárdino were fought, there also exists a definite and well-known, but quite false, conception. All the historians describe the affair as follows:</p><p>The Russian army, they say, in its retreat from Smolénsk sought out for itself the best position for a general engagement and found such a position at Borodinó.</p><p>The Russians, they say, fortified this position in advance on the left of the highroad (from Moscow to Smolénsk) and almost at a right angle to it, from Borodinó to Utítsa, at the very place where the battle was fought.</p>",
  "page-632": "<p>In front of this position, they say, a fortified outpost was set up on the Shevárdino mound to observe the enemy. On the twenty-fourth, we are told, Napoleon attacked this advanced post and took it, and, on the twenty-sixth, attacked the whole Russian army, which was in position on the field of Borodinó.</p><p>So the histories say, and it is all quite wrong, as anyone who cares to look into the matter can easily convince himself.</p><p>The Russians did not seek out the best position but, on the contrary, during the retreat passed many positions better than Borodinó. They did not stop at any one of these positions because Kutúzov did not wish to occupy a position he had not himself chosen, because the popular demand for a battle had not yet expressed itself strongly enough, and because Milorádovich had not yet arrived with the militia, and for many other reasons.</p>",
  "page-633": "<p> The fact is that other positions they had passed were stronger, and that the position at Borodinó (the one where the battle was fought), far from being strong, was no more a position than any other spot one might find in the Russian Empire by sticking a pin into the map at hazard.</p><p>Not only did the Russians not fortify the position on the field of Borodinó to the left of, and at a right angle to, the highroad (that is, the position on which the battle took place), but never till the twenty-fifth of August, 1812, did they think that a battle might be fought there. This was shown first by the fact that there were no entrenchments there by the twenty fifth and that those begun on the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth were not completed, and secondly, by the position of the Shevárdino Redoubt. That redoubt was quite senseless in front of the position where the battle was accepted.</p>",
  "page-634": "<p> Why was it more strongly fortified than any other post? And why were all efforts exhausted and six thousand men sacrificed to defend it till late at night on the twenty-fourth? A Cossack patrol would have sufficed to observe the enemy. Thirdly, as proof that the position on which the battle was fought had not been foreseen and that the Shevárdino Redoubt was not an advanced post of that position, we have the fact that up to the twenty-fifth, Barclay de Tolly and Bagratión were convinced that the Shevárdino Redoubt was the left flank of the position, and that Kutúzov himself in his report, written in hot haste after the battle, speaks of the Shevárdino Redoubt as the left flank of the position.</p>",
  "page-635": "<p> It was much later, when reports on the battle of Borodinó were written at leisure, that the incorrect and extraordinary statement was invented (probably to justify the mistakes of a commander in chief who had to be represented as infallible) that the Shevárdino Redoubt was an advanced post&mdash;whereas in reality it was simply a fortified point on the left flank&mdash;and that the battle of Borodinó was fought by us on an entrenched position previously selected, whereas it was fought on a quite unexpected spot which was almost unentrenched.</p><p>The case was evidently this: a position was selected along the river Kolochá&mdash;which crosses the highroad not at a right angle but at an acute angle&mdash;so that the left flank was at Shevárdino, the right flank near the village of Nóvoe, and the center at Borodinó at the confluence of the rivers Kolochá and Vóyna.</p>",
  "page-636": "<p>To anyone who looks at the field of Borodinó without thinking of how the battle was actually fought, this position, protected by the river Kolochá, presents itself as obvious for an army whose object was to prevent an enemy from advancing along the Smolénsk road to Moscow.</p><p>Napoleon, riding to Valúevo on the twenty-fourth, did not see (as the history books say he did) the position of the Russians from Utítsa to Borodinó (he could not have seen that position because it did not exist), nor did he see an advanced post of the Russian army, but while pursuing the Russian rearguard he came upon the left flank of the Russian position&mdash;at the Shevárdino Redoubt&mdash;and unexpectedly for the Russians moved his army across the Kolochá.</p>",
  "page-637": "<p> And the Russians, not having time to begin a general engagement, withdrew their left wing from the position they had intended to occupy and took up a new position which had not been foreseen and was not fortified. By crossing to the other side of the Kolochá to the left of the highroad, Napoleon shifted the whole forthcoming battle from right to left (looking from the Russian side) and transferred it to the plain between Utítsa, Semënovsk, and Borodinó&mdash;a plain no more advantageous as a position than any other plain in Russia&mdash;and there the whole battle of the twenty-sixth of August took place.</p><p>Had Napoleon not ridden out on the evening of the twenty-fourth to the Kolochá, and had he not then ordered an immediate attack on the redoubt but had begun the attack next morning, no one would have doubted that the Shevárdino Redoubt was the left flank of our position, and the battle would have taken place where we expected it.</p>",
  "page-638": "<p> In that case we should probably have defended the Shevárdino Redoubt&mdash;our left flank&mdash;still more obstinately. We should have attacked Napoleon in the center or on the right, and the engagement would have taken place on the twenty-fifth, in the position we intended and had fortified. But as the attack on our left flank took place in the evening after the retreat of our rear guard (that is, immediately after the fight at Gridnëva), and as the Russian commanders did not wish, or were not in time, to begin a general engagement then on the evening of the twenty-fourth, the first and chief action of the battle of Borodinó was already lost on the twenty-fourth, and obviously led to the loss of the one fought on the twenty-sixth.</p>",
  "page-639": "<p>After the loss of the Shevárdino Redoubt, we found ourselves on the morning of the twenty-fifth without a position for our left flank, and were forced to bend it back and hastily entrench it where it chanced to be.</p><p>Not only was the Russian army on the twenty-sixth defended by weak, unfinished entrenchments, but the disadvantage of that position was increased by the fact that the Russian commanders&mdash;not having fully realized what had happened, namely the loss of our position on the left flank and the shifting of the whole field of the forthcoming battle from right to left&mdash;maintained their extended position from the village of Nóvoe to Utítsa, and consequently had to move their forces from right to left during the battle. So it happened that throughout the whole battle the Russians opposed the entire French army launched against our left flank with but half as many men.</p>",
  "page-640": "<p> (Poniatowski&rsquo;s action against Utítsa, and Uvárov&rsquo;s on the right flank against the French, were actions distinct from the main course of the battle.) So the battle of Borodinó did not take place at all as (in an effort to conceal our commanders&rsquo; mistakes even at the cost of diminishing the glory due to the Russian army and people) it has been described. The battle of Borodinó was not fought on a chosen and entrenched position with forces only slightly weaker than those of the enemy, but, as a result of the loss of the Shevárdino Redoubt, the Russians fought the battle of Borodinó on an open and almost unentrenched position, with forces only half as numerous as the French; that is to say, under conditions in which it was not merely unthinkable to fight for ten hours and secure an indecisive result, but unthinkable to keep an army even from complete disintegration and flight.</p>",

  "page-642": "<p>On the morning of the twenty-fifth Pierre was leaving Mozháysk. At the descent of the high steep hill, down which a winding road led out of the town past the cathedral on the right, where a service was being held and the bells were ringing, Pierre got out of his vehicle and proceeded on foot. Behind him a cavalry regiment was coming down the hill preceded by its singers. Coming up toward him was a train of carts carrying men who had been wounded in the engagement the day before. The peasant drivers, shouting and lashing their horses, kept crossing from side to side. The carts, in each of which three or four wounded soldiers were lying or sitting, jolted over the stones that had been thrown on the steep incline to make it something like a road. The wounded, bandaged with rags, with pale cheeks, compressed lips, and knitted brows, held on to the sides of the carts as they were jolted against one another.</p>",
  "page-643": "<p> Almost all of them stared with naïve, childlike curiosity at Pierre&rsquo;s white hat and green swallow-tail coat.</p><p>Pierre&rsquo;s coachman shouted angrily at the convoy of wounded to keep to one side of the road. The cavalry regiment, as it descended the hill with its singers, surrounded Pierre&rsquo;s carriage and blocked the road. Pierre stopped, being pressed against the side of the cutting in which the road ran. The sunshine from behind the hill did not penetrate into the cutting and there it was cold and damp, but above Pierre&rsquo;s head was the bright August sunshine and the bells sounded merrily. One of the carts with wounded stopped by the side of the road close to Pierre. The driver in his bast shoes ran panting up to it, placed a stone under one of its tireless hind wheels, and began arranging the breech-band on his little horse.</p>",
  "page-644": "<p>One of the wounded, an old soldier with a bandaged arm who was following the cart on foot, caught hold of it with his sound hand and turned to look at Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;I say, fellow countryman! Will they set us down here or take us on to Moscow?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>Pierre was so deep in thought that he did not hear the question. He was looking now at the cavalry regiment that had met the convoy of wounded, now at the cart by which he was standing, in which two wounded men were sitting and one was lying. One of those sitting up in the cart had probably been wounded in the cheek. His whole head was wrapped in rags and one cheek was swollen to the size of a baby&rsquo;s head. His nose and mouth were twisted to one side. This soldier was looking at the cathedral and crossing himself.</p>",
  "page-645": "<p> Another, a young lad, a fair-haired recruit as white as though there was no blood in his thin face, looked at Pierre kindly, with a fixed smile. The third lay prone so that his face was not visible. The cavalry singers were passing close by:</p><p>they sang their soldiers&rsquo; dance song.</p><p>As if responding to them but with a different sort of merriment, the metallic sound of the bells reverberated high above and the hot rays of the sun bathed the top of the opposite slope with yet another sort of merriment. But beneath the slope, by the cart with the wounded near the panting little nag where Pierre stood, it was damp, somber, and sad.</p>",
  "page-646": "<p>The soldier with the swollen cheek looked angrily at the cavalry singers.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, the coxcombs!&rdquo; he muttered reproachfully.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the soldiers only, but I&rsquo;ve seen peasants today, too.... The peasants&mdash;even they have to go,&rdquo; said the soldier behind the cart, addressing Pierre with a sad smile. &ldquo;No distinctions made nowadays.... They want the whole nation to fall on them&mdash;in a word, it&rsquo;s Moscow! They want to make an end of it.&rdquo;</p><p>In spite of the obscurity of the soldier&rsquo;s words Pierre understood what he wanted to say and nodded approval.</p>",
  "page-647": "<p>The road was clear again; Pierre descended the hill and drove on.</p><p>He kept looking to either side of the road for familiar faces, but only saw everywhere the unfamiliar faces of various military men of different branches of the service, who all looked with astonishment at his white hat and green tail coat.</p><p>Having gone nearly three miles he at last met an acquaintance and eagerly addressed him. This was one of the head army doctors. He was driving toward Pierre in a covered gig, sitting beside a young surgeon, and on recognizing Pierre he told the Cossack who occupied the driver&rsquo;s seat to pull up.</p>",
  "page-648": "<p>&ldquo;Count! Your excellency, how come you to be here?&rdquo; asked the doctor.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you know, I wanted to see...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, there will be something to see....&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre got out and talked to the doctor, explaining his intention of taking part in a battle.</p><p>The doctor advised him to apply direct to Kutúzov.</p><p>&ldquo;Why should you be God knows where out of sight, during the battle?&rdquo; he said, exchanging glances with his young companion. &ldquo;Anyhow his Serene Highness knows you and will receive you graciously. That&rsquo;s what you must do.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-649": "<p>The doctor seemed tired and in a hurry.</p><p>&ldquo;You think so?... Ah, I also wanted to ask you where our position is exactly?&rdquo; said Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;The position?&rdquo; repeated the doctor. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s not my line. Drive past Tatárinova, a lot of digging is going on there. Go up the hillock and you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can one see from there?... If you would...&rdquo;</p><p>But the doctor interrupted him and moved toward his gig.</p><p>&ldquo;I would go with you but on my honor I&rsquo;m up to here&rdquo;&mdash;and he pointed to his throat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m galloping to the commander of the corps. How do matters stand?... You know, Count, there&rsquo;ll be a battle tomorrow. Out of an army of a hundred thousand we must expect at least twenty thousand wounded, and we haven&rsquo;t stretchers, or bunks, or dressers, or doctors enough for six thousand.</p>",
  "page-650": "<p> We have ten thousand carts, but we need other things as well&mdash;we must manage as best we can!&rdquo;</p><p>The strange thought that of the thousands of men, young and old, who had stared with merry surprise at his hat (perhaps the very men he had noticed), twenty thousand were inevitably doomed to wounds and death amazed Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;They may die tomorrow; why are they thinking of anything but death?&rdquo; And by some latent sequence of thought the descent of the Mozháysk hill, the carts with the wounded, the ringing bells, the slanting rays of the sun, and the songs of the cavalrymen vividly recurred to his mind.</p>",
  "page-651": "<p>&ldquo;The cavalry ride to battle and meet the wounded and do not for a moment think of what awaits them, but pass by, winking at the wounded. Yet from among these men twenty thousand are doomed to die, and they wonder at my hat! Strange!&rdquo; thought Pierre, continuing his way to Tatárinova.</p><p>In front of a landowner&rsquo;s house to the left of the road stood carriages, wagons, and crowds of orderlies and sentinels. The commander in chief was putting up there, but just when Pierre arrived he was not in and hardly any of the staff were there&mdash;they had gone to the church service. Pierre drove on toward Górki.</p>",
  "page-652": "<p>When he had ascended the hill and reached the little village street, he saw for the first time peasant militiamen in their white shirts and with crosses on their caps, who, talking and laughing loudly, animated and perspiring, were at work on a huge knoll overgrown with grass to the right of the road.</p><p>Some of them were digging, others were wheeling barrowloads of earth along planks, while others stood about doing nothing.</p><p>Two officers were standing on the knoll, directing the men. On seeing these peasants, who were evidently still amused by the novelty of their position as soldiers, Pierre once more thought of the wounded men at Mozháysk and understood what the soldier had meant when he said: &ldquo;They want the whole nation to fall on them.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-653": "<p> The sight of these bearded peasants at work on the battlefield, with their queer, clumsy boots and perspiring necks, and their shirts opening from the left toward the middle, unfastened, exposing their sunburned collarbones, impressed Pierre more strongly with the solemnity and importance of the moment than anything he had yet seen or heard.</p>",
  "page-654": "<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>",
  "page-655": "<p>Pierre stepped out of his carriage and, passing the toiling militiamen, ascended the knoll from which, according to the doctor, the battlefield could be seen.</p><p>It was about eleven o&rsquo;clock. The sun shone somewhat to the left and behind him and brightly lit up the enormous panorama which, rising like an amphitheater, extended before him in the clear rarefied atmosphere.</p><p>From above on the left, bisecting that amphitheater, wound the Smolénsk highroad, passing through a village with a white church some five hundred paces in front of the knoll and below it. This was Borodinó. Below the village the road crossed the river by a bridge and, winding down and up, rose higher and higher to the village of Valúevo visible about four miles away, where Napoleon was then stationed. Beyond Valúevo the road disappeared into a yellowing forest on the horizon.</p>",
  "page-656": "<p> Far in the distance in that birch and fir forest to the right of the road, the cross and belfry of the Kolochá Monastery gleamed in the sun. Here and there over the whole of that blue expanse, to right and left of the forest and the road, smoking campfires could be seen and indefinite masses of troops&mdash;ours and the enemy&rsquo;s. The ground to the right&mdash;along the course of the Kolochá and Moskvá rivers&mdash;was broken and hilly. Between the hollows the villages of Bezúbova and Zakhárino showed in the distance. On the left the ground was more level; there were fields of grain, and the smoking ruins of Semënovsk, which had been burned down, could be seen.</p><p>All that Pierre saw was so indefinite that neither the left nor the right side of the field fully satisfied his expectations.</p>",
  "page-657": "<p> Nowhere could he see the battlefield he had expected to find, but only fields, meadows, troops, woods, the smoke of campfires, villages, mounds, and streams; and try as he would he could descry no military &ldquo;position&rdquo; in this place which teemed with life, nor could he even distinguish our troops from the enemy&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;I must ask someone who knows,&rdquo; he thought, and addressed an officer who was looking with curiosity at his huge unmilitary figure.</p><p>&ldquo;May I ask you,&rdquo; said Pierre, &ldquo;what village that is in front?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Búrdino, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said the officer, turning to his companion.</p>",
  "page-658": "<p>&ldquo;Borodinó,&rdquo; the other corrected him.</p><p>The officer, evidently glad of an opportunity for a talk, moved up to Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;Are those our men there?&rdquo; Pierre inquired.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, and there, further on, are the French,&rdquo; said the officer. &ldquo;There they are, there... you can see them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where? Where?&rdquo; asked Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;One can see them with the naked eye... Why, there!&rdquo;</p><p>The officer pointed with his hand to the smoke visible on the left beyond the river, and the same stern and serious expression that Pierre had noticed on many of the faces he had met came into his face.</p>",
  "page-659": "<p>&ldquo;Ah, those are the French! And over there?...&rdquo; Pierre pointed to a knoll on the left, near which some troops could be seen.</p><p>&ldquo;Those are ours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, ours! And there?...&rdquo; Pierre pointed to another knoll in the distance with a big tree on it, near a village that lay in a hollow where also some campfires were smoking and something black was visible.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s his again,&rdquo; said the officer. (It was the Shevárdino Redoubt.) &ldquo;It was ours yesterday, but now it is his.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-660": "<p>&ldquo;Then how about our position?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Our position?&rdquo; replied the officer with a smile of satisfaction. &ldquo;I can tell you quite clearly, because I constructed nearly all our entrenchments. There, you see? There&rsquo;s our center, at Borodinó, just there,&rdquo; and he pointed to the village in front of them with the white church. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where one crosses the Kolochá. You see down there where the rows of hay are lying in the hollow, there&rsquo;s the bridge. That&rsquo;s our center. Our right flank is over there&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed sharply to the right, far away in the broken ground&mdash;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the Moskvá River is, and we have thrown up three redoubts there, very strong ones. The left flank...&rdquo; here the officer paused. &ldquo;Well, you see, that&rsquo;s difficult to explain....</p>",
  "page-661": "<p> Yesterday our left flank was there at Shevárdino, you see, where the oak is, but now we have withdrawn our left wing&mdash;now it is over there, do you see that village and the smoke? That&rsquo;s Semënovsk, yes, there,&rdquo; he pointed to Raévski&rsquo;s knoll. &ldquo;But the battle will hardly be there. His having moved his troops there is only a ruse; he will probably pass round to the right of the Moskvá. But wherever it may be, many a man will be missing tomorrow!&rdquo; he remarked.</p><p>An elderly sergeant who had approached the officer while he was giving these explanations had waited in silence for him to finish speaking, but at this point, evidently not liking the officer&rsquo;s remark, interrupted him.</p>",
  "page-662": "<p>&ldquo;Gabions must be sent for,&rdquo; said he sternly.</p><p>The officer appeared abashed, as though he understood that one might think of how many men would be missing tomorrow but ought not to speak of it.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, send number three company again,&rdquo; the officer replied hurriedly.</p><p>&ldquo;And you, are you one of the doctors?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve come on my own,&rdquo; answered Pierre, and he went down the hill again, passing the militiamen.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, those damned fellows!&rdquo; muttered the officer who followed him, holding his nose as he ran past the men at work.</p>",
  "page-663": "<p>&ldquo;There they are... bringing her, coming... There they are... They&rsquo;ll be here in a minute...&rdquo; voices were suddenly heard saying; and officers, soldiers, and militiamen began running forward along the road.</p><p>A church procession was coming up the hill from Borodinó. First along the dusty road came the infantry in ranks, bareheaded and with arms reversed. From behind them came the sound of church singing.</p><p>Soldiers and militiamen ran bareheaded past Pierre toward the procession.</p><p>&ldquo;They are bringing her, our Protectress!... The Iberian Mother of God!&rdquo; someone cried.</p><p>&ldquo;The Smolénsk Mother of God,&rdquo; another corrected him.</p>",
  "page-664": "<p>The militiamen, both those who had been in the village and those who had been at work on the battery, threw down their spades and ran to meet the church procession. Following the battalion that marched along the dusty road came priests in their vestments&mdash;one little old man in a hood with attendants and singers. Behind them soldiers and officers bore a large, dark-faced icon with an embossed metal cover. This was the icon that had been brought from Smolénsk and had since accompanied the army. Behind, before, and on both sides, crowds of militiamen with bared heads walked, ran, and bowed to the ground.</p><p>At the summit of the hill they stopped with the icon; the men who had been holding it up by the linen bands attached to it were relieved by others, the chanters relit their censers, and service began.</p>",
  "page-665": "<p> The hot rays of the sun beat down vertically and a fresh soft wind played with the hair of the bared heads and with the ribbons decorating the icon. The singing did not sound loud under the open sky. An immense crowd of bareheaded officers, soldiers, and militiamen surrounded the icon. Behind the priest and a chanter stood the notabilities on a spot reserved for them. A bald general with a St. George&rsquo;s Cross on his neck stood just behind the priest&rsquo;s back, and without crossing himself (he was evidently a German) patiently awaited the end of the service, which he considered it necessary to hear to the end, probably to arouse the patriotism of the Russian people. Another general stood in a martial pose, crossing himself by shaking his hand in front of his chest while looking about him.</p>",
  "page-666": "<p> Standing among the crowd of peasants, Pierre recognized several acquaintances among these notables, but did not look at them&mdash;his whole attention was absorbed in watching the serious expression on the faces of the crowd of soldiers and militiamen who were all gazing eagerly at the icon. As soon as the tired chanters, who were singing the service for the twentieth time that day, began lazily and mechanically to sing: &ldquo;Save from calamity Thy servants, O Mother of God,&rdquo; and the priest and deacon chimed in: &ldquo;For to Thee under God we all flee as to an inviolable bulwark and protection,&rdquo; there again kindled in all those faces the same expression of consciousness of the solemnity of the impending moment that Pierre had seen on the faces at the foot of the hill at Mozháysk and momentarily on many and many faces he had met that morning;</p>",
  "page-667": "<p> and heads were bowed more frequently and hair tossed back, and sighs and the sound men made as they crossed themselves were heard.</p><p>The crowd round the icon suddenly parted and pressed against Pierre. Someone, a very important personage judging by the haste with which way was made for him, was approaching the icon.</p><p>It was Kutúzov, who had been riding round the position and on his way back to Tatárinova had stopped where the service was being held. Pierre recognized him at once by his peculiar figure, which distinguished him from everybody else.</p><p>With a long overcoat on his exceedingly stout, round-shouldered body, with uncovered white head and puffy face showing the white ball of the eye he had lost, Kutúzov walked with plunging, swaying gait into the crowd and stopped behind the priest.</p>",
  "page-668": "<p> He crossed himself with an accustomed movement, bent till he touched the ground with his hand, and bowed his white head with a deep sigh. Behind Kutúzov was Bennigsen and the suite. Despite the presence of the commander in chief, who attracted the attention of all the superior officers, the militiamen and soldiers continued their prayers without looking at him.</p><p>When the service was over, Kutúzov stepped up to the icon, sank heavily to his knees, bowed to the ground, and for a long time tried vainly to rise, but could not do so on account of his weakness and weight. His white head twitched with the effort. At last he rose, kissed the icon as a child does with naïvely pouting lips, and again bowed till he touched the ground with his hand.</p>",
  "page-669": "<p> The other generals followed his example, then the officers, and after them with excited faces, pressing on one another, crowding, panting, and pushing, scrambled the soldiers and militiamen.</p>",
  "page-670": "<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>",
  "page-671": "<p>Staggering amid the crush, Pierre looked about him.</p><p>&ldquo;Count Peter Kirílovich! How did you get here?&rdquo; said a voice.</p><p>Pierre looked round. Borís Drubetskóy, brushing his knees with his hand (he had probably soiled them when he, too, had knelt before the icon), came up to him smiling. Borís was elegantly dressed, with a slightly martial touch appropriate to a campaign. He wore a long coat and like Kutúzov had a whip slung across his shoulder.</p><p>Meanwhile Kutúzov had reached the village and seated himself in the shade of the nearest house, on a bench which one Cossack had run to fetch and another had hastily covered with a rug. An immense and brilliant suite surrounded him.</p>",
  "page-672": "<p>The icon was carried further, accompanied by the throng. Pierre stopped some thirty paces from Kutúzov, talking to Borís.</p><p>He explained his wish to be present at the battle and to see the position.</p><p>&ldquo;This is what you must do,&rdquo; said Borís. &ldquo;I will do the honors of the camp to you. You will see everything best from where Count Bennigsen will be. I am in attendance on him, you know; I&rsquo;ll mention it to him. But if you want to ride round the position, come along with us. We are just going to the left flank. Then when we get back, do spend the night with me and we&rsquo;ll arrange a game of cards. Of course you know Dmítri Sergéevich? Those are his quarters,&rdquo; and he pointed to the third house in the village of Górki.</p>",
  "page-673": "<p>&ldquo;But I should like to see the right flank. They say it&rsquo;s very strong,&rdquo; said Pierre. &ldquo;I should like to start from the Moskvá River and ride round the whole position.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you can do that later, but the chief thing is the left flank.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. But where is Prince Bolkónski&rsquo;s regiment? Can you point it out to me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Prince Andrew&rsquo;s? We shall pass it and I&rsquo;ll take you to him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What about the left flank?&rdquo; asked Pierre</p>",
  "page-674": "<p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth, between ourselves, God only knows what state our left flank is in,&rdquo; said Borís confidentially lowering his voice. &ldquo;It is not at all what Count Bennigsen intended. He meant to fortify that knoll quite differently, but...&rdquo; Borís shrugged his shoulders, &ldquo;his Serene Highness would not have it, or someone persuaded him. You see...&rdquo; but Borís did not finish, for at that moment Kaysárov, Kutúzov&rsquo;s adjutant, came up to Pierre. &ldquo;Ah, Kaysárov!&rdquo; said Borís, addressing him with an unembarrassed smile, &ldquo;I was just trying to explain our position to the count. It is amazing how his Serene Highness could so foresee the intentions of the French!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-675": "<p>&ldquo;You mean the left flank?&rdquo; asked Kaysárov.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, exactly; the left flank is now extremely strong.&rdquo;</p><p>Though Kutúzov had dismissed all unnecessary men from the staff, Borís had contrived to remain at headquarters after the changes. He had established himself with Count Bennigsen, who, like all on whom Borís had been in attendance, considered young Prince Drubetskóy an invaluable man.</p><p>In the higher command there were two sharply defined parties: Kutúzov&rsquo;s party and that of Bennigsen, the chief of staff. Borís belonged to the latter and no one else, while showing servile respect to Kutúzov, could so create an impression that the old fellow was not much good and that Bennigsen managed everything. Now the decisive moment of battle had come when Kutúzov would be destroyed and the power pass to Bennigsen, or even if Kutúzov won the battle it would be felt that everything was done by Bennigsen.</p>",
  "page-676": "<p> In any case many great rewards would have to be given for tomorrow&rsquo;s action, and new men would come to the front. So Borís was full of nervous vivacity all day.</p><p>After Kaysárov, others whom Pierre knew came up to him, and he had not time to reply to all the questions about Moscow that were showered upon him, or to listen to all that was told him. The faces all expressed animation and apprehension, but it seemed to Pierre that the cause of the excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in questions of personal success; his mind, however, was occupied by the different expression he saw on other faces&mdash;an expression that spoke not of personal matters but of the universal questions of life and death. Kutúzov noticed Pierre&rsquo;s figure and the group gathered round him.</p>",
  "page-677": "<p>&ldquo;Call him to me,&rdquo; said Kutúzov.</p><p>An adjutant told Pierre of his Serene Highness&rsquo; wish, and Pierre went toward Kutúzov&rsquo;s bench. But a militiaman got there before him. It was Dólokhov.</p><p>&ldquo;How did that fellow get here?&rdquo; asked Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a creature that wriggles in anywhere!&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;He has been degraded, you know. Now he wants to bob up again. He&rsquo;s been proposing some scheme or other and has crawled into the enemy&rsquo;s picket line at night.... He&rsquo;s a brave fellow.&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to Kutúzov.</p>",
  "page-678": "<p>&ldquo;I concluded that if I reported to your Serene Highness you might send me away or say that you knew what I was reporting, but then I shouldn&rsquo;t lose anything...&rdquo; Dólokhov was saying.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But if I were right, I should be rendering a service to my Fatherland for which I am ready to die.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And should your Serene Highness require a man who will not spare his skin, please think of me.... Perhaps I may prove useful to your Serene Highness.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-679": "<p>&ldquo;Yes... Yes...&rdquo; Kutúzov repeated, his laughing eye narrowing more and more as he looked at Pierre.</p><p>Just then Borís, with his courtierlike adroitness, stepped up to Pierre&rsquo;s side near Kutúzov and in a most natural manner, without raising his voice, said to Pierre, as though continuing an interrupted conversation:</p><p>&ldquo;The militia have put on clean white shirts to be ready to die. What heroism, Count!&rdquo;</p><p>Borís evidently said this to Pierre in order to be overheard by his Serene Highness. He knew Kutúzov&rsquo;s attention would be caught by those words, and so it was.</p>",
  "page-680": "<p>&ldquo;What are you saying about the militia?&rdquo; he asked Borís.</p><p>&ldquo;Preparing for tomorrow, your Serene Highness&mdash;for death&mdash;they have put on clean shirts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah... a wonderful, a matchless people!&rdquo; said Kutúzov; and he closed his eyes and swayed his head. &ldquo;A matchless people!&rdquo; he repeated with a sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;So you want to smell gunpowder?&rdquo; he said to Pierre. &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a pleasant smell. I have the honor to be one of your wife&rsquo;s adorers. Is she well? My quarters are at your service.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-681": "<p>And as often happens with old people, Kutúzov began looking about absent-mindedly as if forgetting all he wanted to say or do.</p><p>Then, evidently remembering what he wanted, he beckoned to Andrew Kaysárov, his adjutant&rsquo;s brother.</p><p>&ldquo;Those verses... those verses of Márin&rsquo;s... how do they go, eh? Those he wrote about Gerákov: &lsquo;Lectures for the corps inditing&rsquo;... Recite them, recite them!&rdquo; said he, evidently preparing to laugh.</p><p>Kaysárov recited.... Kutúzov smilingly nodded his head to the rhythm of the verses.</p><p>When Pierre had left Kutúzov, Dólokhov came up to him and took his hand.</p>",
  "page-682": "<p>&ldquo;I am very glad to meet you here, Count,&rdquo; he said aloud, regardless of the presence of strangers and in a particularly resolute and solemn tone. &ldquo;On the eve of a day when God alone knows who of us is fated to survive, I am glad of this opportunity to tell you that I regret the misunderstandings that occurred between us and should wish you not to have any ill feeling for me. I beg you to forgive me.&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre looked at Dólokhov with a smile, not knowing what to say to him. With tears in his eyes Dólokhov embraced Pierre and kissed him.</p><p>Borís said a few words to his general, and Count Bennigsen turned to Pierre and proposed that he should ride with him along the line.</p>",
  "page-683": "<p>&ldquo;It will interest you,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, very much,&rdquo; replied Pierre.</p><p>Half an hour later Kutúzov left for Tatárinova, and Bennigsen and his suite, with Pierre among them, set out on their ride along the line.</p>",
  "page-684": "<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>",
  "page-685": "<p>From Górki, Bennigsen descended the highroad to the bridge which, when they had looked at it from the hill, the officer had pointed out as being the center of our position and where rows of fragrant new-mown hay lay by the riverside. They rode across that bridge into the village of Borodinó and thence turned to the left, passing an enormous number of troops and guns, and came to a high knoll where militiamen were digging. This was the redoubt, as yet unnamed, which afterwards became known as the Raévski Redoubt, or the Knoll Battery, but Pierre paid no special attention to it. He did not know that it would become more memorable to him than any other spot on the plain of Borodinó.</p>",
  "page-686": "<p>They then crossed the hollow to Semënovsk, where the soldiers were dragging away the last logs from the huts and barns. Then they rode downhill and uphill, across a ryefield trodden and beaten down as if by hail, following a track freshly made by the artillery over the furrows of the plowed land, and reached some flèches * which were still being dug.</p><p>At the flèches Bennigsen stopped and began looking at the Shevárdino Redoubt opposite, which had been ours the day before and where several horsemen could be descried. The officers said that either Napoleon or Murat was there, and they all gazed eagerly at this little group of horsemen. Pierre also looked at them, trying to guess which of the scarcely discernible figures was Napoleon. At last those mounted men rode away from the mound and disappeared.</p>",
  "page-687": "<p>Bennigsen spoke to a general who approached him, and began explaining the whole position of our troops. Pierre listened to him, straining each faculty to understand the essential points of the impending battle, but was mortified to feel that his mental capacity was inadequate for the task. He could make nothing of it. Bennigsen stopped speaking and, noticing that Pierre was listening, suddenly said to him:</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think this interests you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On the contrary it&rsquo;s very interesting!&rdquo; replied Pierre not quite truthfully.</p><p>From the flèches they rode still farther to the left, along a road winding through a thick, low-growing birch wood. In the middle of the wood a brown hare with white feet sprang out and, scared by the tramp of the many horses, grew so confused that it leaped along the road in front of them for some time, arousing general attention and</p>",
  "page-688": "<p>laughter, and only when several voices shouted at it did it dart to one side and disappear in the thicket. After going through the wood for about a mile and a half they came out on a glade where troops of Túchkov&rsquo;s corps were stationed to defend the left flank.</p><p>Here, at the extreme left flank, Bennigsen talked a great deal and with much heat, and, as it seemed to Pierre, gave orders of great military importance. In front of Túchkov&rsquo;s troops was some high ground not occupied by troops. Bennigsen loudly criticized this mistake, saying that it was madness to leave a height which commanded the country around unoccupied and to place troops below it. Some of the generals expressed the same opinion. One in particular declared with martial heat that they were put there to be slaughtered.</p>",
  "page-689": "<p> Bennigsen on his own authority ordered the troops to occupy the high ground. This disposition on the left flank increased Pierre&rsquo;s doubt of his own capacity to understand military matters. Listening to Bennigsen and the generals criticizing the position of the troops behind the hill, he quite understood them and shared their opinion, but for that very reason he could not understand how the man who put them there behind the hill could have made so gross and palpable a blunder.</p><p>Pierre did not know that these troops were not, as Bennigsen supposed, put there to defend the position, but were in a concealed position as an ambush, that they should not be seen and might be able to strike an approaching enemy unexpectedly. Bennigsen did not know this and moved the troops forward according to his own ideas without mentioning the matter to the commander in chief.</p>",

  "page-691": "<p>On that bright evening of August 25, Prince Andrew lay leaning on his elbow in a broken-down shed in the village of Knyazkóvo at the further end of his regiment&rsquo;s encampment. Through a gap in the broken wall he could see, beside the wooden fence, a row of thirty-year-old birches with their lower branches lopped off, a field on which shocks of oats were standing, and some bushes near which rose the smoke of campfires&mdash;the soldiers&rsquo; kitchens.</p><p>Narrow and burdensome and useless to anyone as his life now seemed to him, Prince Andrew on the eve of battle felt agitated and irritable as he had done seven years before at Austerlitz.</p>",
  "page-692": "<p>He had received and given the orders for next day&rsquo;s battle and had nothing more to do. But his thoughts&mdash;the simplest, clearest, and therefore most terrible thoughts&mdash;would give him no peace. He knew that tomorrow&rsquo;s battle would be the most terrible of all he had taken part in, and for the first time in his life the possibility of death presented itself to him&mdash;not in relation to any worldly matter or with reference to its effect on others, but simply in relation to himself, to his own soul&mdash;vividly, plainly, terribly, and almost as a certainty. And from the height of this perception all that had previously tormented and preoccupied him suddenly became illumined by a cold white light without shadows, without perspective, without distinction of outline. All life appeared to him like magic-lantern pictures at which he had long been gazing by artificial light through a glass.</p>",
  "page-693": "<p> Now he suddenly saw those badly daubed pictures in clear daylight and without a glass. &ldquo;Yes, yes! There they are, those false images that agitated, enraptured, and tormented me,&rdquo; said he to himself, passing in review the principal pictures of the magic lantern of life and regarding them now in the cold white daylight of his clear perception of death. &ldquo;There they are, those rudely painted figures that once seemed splendid and mysterious. Glory, the good of society, love of a woman, the Fatherland itself&mdash;how important these pictures appeared to me, with what profound meaning they seemed to be filled! And it is all so simple, pale, and crude in the cold white light of this morning which I feel is dawning for me.&rdquo; The three great sorrows of his life held his attention in particular: his love for a woman, his father&rsquo;s death, and the French invasion which had overrun half Russia.</p>",
  "page-694": "<p> &ldquo;Love... that little girl who seemed to me brimming over with mystic forces! Yes, indeed, I loved her. I made romantic plans of love and happiness with her! Oh, what a boy I was!&rdquo; he said aloud bitterly. &ldquo;Ah me! I believed in some ideal love which was to keep her faithful to me for the whole year of my absence! Like the gentle dove in the fable she was to pine apart from me.... But it was much simpler really.... It was all very simple and horrible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When my father built Bald Hills he thought the place was his: his land, his air, his peasants. But Napoleon came and swept him aside, unconscious of his existence, as he might brush a chip from his path, and his Bald Hills and his whole life fell to pieces. Princess Mary says it is a trial sent from above.</p>",
  "page-695": "<p> What is the trial for, when he is not here and will never return? He is not here! For whom then is the trial intended? The Fatherland, the destruction of Moscow! And tomorrow I shall be killed, perhaps not even by a Frenchman but by one of our own men, by a soldier discharging a musket close to my ear as one of them did yesterday, and the French will come and take me by head and heels and fling me into a hole that I may not stink under their noses, and new conditions of life will arise, which will seem quite ordinary to others and about which I shall know nothing. I shall not exist....&rdquo;</p><p>He looked at the row of birches shining in the sunshine, with their motionless green and yellow foliage and white bark. &ldquo;To die... to be killed tomorrow... That I should not exist... That all this should still be, but no me....&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-696": "<p>And the birches with their light and shade, the curly clouds, the smoke of the campfires, and all that was around him changed and seemed terrible and menacing. A cold shiver ran down his spine. He rose quickly, went out of the shed, and began to walk about.</p><p>After he had returned, voices were heard outside the shed. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he cried.</p><p>The red-nosed Captain Timókhin, formerly Dólokhov&rsquo;s squadron commander, but now from lack of officers a battalion commander, shyly entered the shed followed by an adjutant and the regimental paymaster.</p><p>Prince Andrew rose hastily, listened to the business they had come about, gave them some further instructions, and was about to dismiss them when he heard a familiar, lisping, voice behind the shed.</p>",
  "page-697": "<p>&ldquo;Devil take it!&rdquo; said the voice of a man stumbling over something.</p><p>Prince Andrew looked out of the shed and saw Pierre, who had tripped over a pole on the ground and had nearly fallen, coming his way. It was unpleasant to Prince Andrew to meet people of his own set in general, and Pierre especially, for he reminded him of all the painful moments of his last visit to Moscow.</p><p>&ldquo;You? What a surprise!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What brings you here? This is unexpected!&rdquo;</p><p>As he said this his eyes and face expressed more than coldness&mdash;they expressed hostility, which Pierre noticed at once. He had approached the shed full of animation, but on seeing Prince Andrew&rsquo;s face he felt constrained and ill at ease.</p>",
  "page-698": "<p>&ldquo;I have come... simply... you know... come... it interests me,&rdquo; said Pierre, who had so often that day senselessly repeated that word &ldquo;interesting.&rdquo; &ldquo;I wish to see the battle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yes, and what do the Masonic brothers say about war? How would they stop it?&rdquo; said Prince Andrew sarcastically. &ldquo;Well, and how&rsquo;s Moscow? And my people? Have they reached Moscow at last?&rdquo; he asked seriously.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, they have. Julie Drubetskáya told me so. I went to see them, but missed them. They have gone to your estate near Moscow.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-699": "<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>",
  "page-700": "<p>The officers were about to take leave, but Prince Andrew, apparently reluctant to be left alone with his friend, asked them to stay and have tea. Seats were brought in and so was the tea. The officers gazed with surprise at Pierre&rsquo;s huge stout figure and listened to his talk of Moscow and the position of our army, round which he had ridden. Prince Andrew remained silent, and his expression was so forbidding that Pierre addressed his remarks chiefly to the good-natured battalion commander.</p><p>&ldquo;So you understand the whole position of our troops?&rdquo; Prince Andrew interrupted him.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;that is, how do you mean?&rdquo; said Pierre. &ldquo;Not being a military man I can&rsquo;t say I have understood it fully, but I understand the general position.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-701": "<p>&ldquo;Well, then, you know more than anyone else, be it who it may,&rdquo; said Prince Andrew.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Pierre, looking over his spectacles in perplexity at Prince Andrew. &ldquo;Well, and what do you think of Kutúzov&rsquo;s appointment?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I was very glad of his appointment, that&rsquo;s all I know,&rdquo; replied Prince Andrew.</p><p>&ldquo;And tell me your opinion of Barclay de Tolly. In Moscow they are saying heaven knows what about him.... What do you think of him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ask them,&rdquo; replied Prince Andrew, indicating the officers.</p>",
  "page-702": "<p>Pierre looked at Timókhin with the condescendingly interrogative smile with which everybody involuntarily addressed that officer.</p><p>&ldquo;We see light again, since his Serenity has been appointed, your excellency,&rdquo; said Timókhin timidly, and continually turning to glance at his colonel.</p><p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; asked Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, to mention only firewood and fodder, let me inform you. Why, when we were retreating from Sventsyáni we dare not touch a stick or a wisp of hay or anything. You see, we were going away, so he would get it all; wasn&rsquo;t it so, your excellency?&rdquo; and again Timókhin turned to the prince. &ldquo;But we daren&rsquo;t. In our regiment two officers were court-martialed for that kind of thing. But when his Serenity took command everything became straightforward. Now we see light....&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-703": "<p>&ldquo;Then why was it forbidden?&rdquo;</p><p>Timókhin looked about in confusion, not knowing what or how to answer such a question. Pierre put the same question to Prince Andrew.</p><p>&ldquo;Why, so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the enemy,&rdquo; said Prince Andrew with venomous irony. &ldquo;It is very sound: one can&rsquo;t permit the land to be pillaged and accustom the troops to marauding. At Smolénsk too he judged correctly that the French might outflank us, as they had larger forces. But he could not understand this,&rdquo; cried Prince Andrew in a shrill voice that seemed to escape him involuntarily: &ldquo;he could not understand that there, for the first time, we were fighting for Russian soil, and that there was a spirit in the men such as I had never seen before, that we had held the French for two days, and that that success had increased our strength tenfold.</p>",
  "page-704": "<p> He ordered us to retreat, and all our efforts and losses went for nothing. He had no thought of betraying us, he tried to do the best he could, he thought out everything, and that is why he is unsuitable. He is unsuitable now, just because he plans out everything very thoroughly and accurately as every German has to. How can I explain?... Well, say your father has a German valet, and he is a splendid valet and satisfies your father&rsquo;s requirements better than you could, then it&rsquo;s all right to let him serve. But if your father is mortally sick you&rsquo;ll send the valet away and attend to your father with your own unpracticed, awkward hands, and will soothe him better than a skilled man who is a stranger could. So it has been with Barclay. While Russia was well, a foreigner could serve her and be a splendid minister; but as soon as she is in danger she needs one of her own kin.</p>",
  "page-705": "<p> But in your Club they have been making him out a traitor! They slander him as a traitor, and the only result will be that afterwards, ashamed of their false accusations, they will make him out a hero or a genius instead of a traitor, and that will be still more unjust. He is an honest and very punctilious German.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And they say he&rsquo;s a skillful commander,&rdquo; rejoined Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what is meant by &lsquo;a skillful commander,&rsquo;&rdquo; replied Prince Andrew ironically.</p><p>&ldquo;A skillful commander?&rdquo; replied Pierre. &ldquo;Why, one who foresees all contingencies... and foresees the adversary&rsquo;s intentions.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-706": "<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; said Prince Andrew as if it were a matter settled long ago.</p><p>Pierre looked at him in surprise.</p><p>&ldquo;And yet they say that war is like a game of chess?&rdquo; he remarked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Prince Andrew, &ldquo;but with this little difference, that in chess you may think over each move as long as you please and are not limited for time, and with this difference too, that a knight is always stronger than a pawn, and two pawns are always stronger than one, while in war a battalion is sometimes stronger than a division and sometimes weaker than a company. The relative strength of bodies of troops can never be known to anyone. Believe me,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;if things depended on arrangements made by the staff, I should be there making arrangements, but instead of that I have the honor to serve here in the regiment with these gentlemen, and I consider that on us tomorrow&rsquo;</p>",
  "page-707": "<p>s battle will depend and not on those others.... Success never depends, and never will depend, on position, or equipment, or even on numbers, and least of all on position.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But on what then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On the feeling that is in me and in him,&rdquo; he pointed to Timókhin, &ldquo;and in each soldier.&rdquo;</p><p>Prince Andrew glanced at Timókhin, who looked at his commander in alarm and bewilderment. In contrast to his former reticent taciturnity Prince Andrew now seemed excited. He could apparently not refrain from expressing the thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him.</p><p>&ldquo;A battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it! Why did we lose the battle at Austerlitz? The French losses were almost equal to ours, but very early we said to ourselves that we were losing the battle, and we did lose it.</p>",
  "page-708": "<p> And we said so because we had nothing to fight for there, we wanted to get away from the battlefield as soon as we could. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve lost, so let us run,&rsquo; and we ran. If we had not said that till the evening, heaven knows what might not have happened. But tomorrow we shan&rsquo;t say it! You talk about our position, the left flank weak and the right flank too extended,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all nonsense, there&rsquo;s nothing of the kind. But what awaits us tomorrow? A hundred million most diverse chances which will be decided on the instant by the fact that our men or theirs run or do not run, and that this man or that man is killed, but all that is being done at present is only play. The fact is that those men with whom you have ridden round the position not only do not help matters, but hinder. They are only concerned with their own petty interests.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-709": "<p>&ldquo;At such a moment?&rdquo; said Pierre reproachfully.</p><p>&ldquo;At such a moment!&rdquo; Prince Andrew repeated. &ldquo;To them it is only a moment affording opportunities to undermine a rival and obtain an extra cross or ribbon. For me tomorrow means this: a Russian army of a hundred thousand and a French army of a hundred thousand have met to fight, and the thing is that these two hundred thousand men will fight and the side that fights more fiercely and spares itself least will win. And if you like I will tell you that whatever happens and whatever muddles those at the top may make, we shall win tomorrow&rsquo;s battle. Tomorrow, happen what may, we shall win!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-710": "<p>&ldquo;There now, your excellency! That&rsquo;s the truth, the real truth,&rdquo; said Timókhin. &ldquo;Who would spare himself now? The soldiers in my battalion, believe me, wouldn&rsquo;t drink their vodka! &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not the day for that!&rsquo; they say.&rdquo;</p><p>All were silent. The officers rose. Prince Andrew went out of the shed with them, giving final orders to the adjutant. After they had gone Pierre approached Prince Andrew and was about to start a conversation when they heard the clatter of three horses&rsquo; hoofs on the road not far from the shed, and looking in that direction Prince Andrew recognized Wolzogen and Clausewitz accompanied by a Cossack. They rode close by continuing to converse, and Prince Andrew involuntarily heard these words:</p>",
  "page-711": "<p>&ldquo;Der Krieg muss in Raum verlegt werden. Der Ansicht kann ich nicht genug Preis geben,&rdquo; * said one of them.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, ja,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;der Zweck ist nur den Feind zu schwächen, so kann man gewiss nicht den Verlust der Privat-Personen in Achtung nehmen.&rdquo; *</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; agreed the other.</p><p>&ldquo;Extend widely!&rdquo; said Prince Andrew with an angry snort, when they had ridden past. &ldquo;In that &lsquo;extend&rsquo; were my father, son, and sister, at Bald Hills. That&rsquo;s all the same to him! That&rsquo;s what I was saying to you&mdash;those German gentlemen won&rsquo;t win the battle tomorrow but will only make all the mess they can, because they have nothing in their German heads but theories not worth an empty eggshell and haven&rsquo;t in their hearts the one thing needed tomorrow&mdash;that which Timókhin has.</p>",
  "page-712": "<p> They have yielded up all Europe to him, and have now come to teach us. Fine teachers!&rdquo; and again his voice grew shrill.</p><p>&ldquo;So you think we shall win tomorrow&rsquo;s battle?&rdquo; asked Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; answered Prince Andrew absently. &ldquo;One thing I would do if I had the power,&rdquo; he began again, &ldquo;I would not take prisoners. Why take prisoners? It&rsquo;s chivalry! The French have destroyed my home and are on their way to destroy Moscow, they have outraged and are outraging me every moment. They are my enemies. In my opinion they are all criminals. And so thinks Timókhin and the whole army. They should be executed! Since they are my foes they cannot be my friends, whatever may have been said at Tilsit.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-713": "<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; muttered Pierre, looking with shining eyes at Prince Andrew. &ldquo;I quite agree with you!&rdquo;</p><p>The question that had perturbed Pierre on the Mozháysk hill and all that day now seemed to him quite clear and completely solved. He now understood the whole meaning and importance of this war and of the impending battle. All he had seen that day, all the significant and stern expressions on the faces he had seen in passing, were lit up for him by a new light. He understood that latent heat (as they say in physics) of patriotism which was present in all these men he had seen, and this explained to him why they all prepared for death calmly, and as it were lightheartedly.</p>",
  "page-714": "<p>&ldquo;Not take prisoners,&rdquo; Prince Andrew continued: &ldquo;That by itself would quite change the whole war and make it less cruel. As it is we have played at war&mdash;that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s vile! We play at magnanimity and all that stuff. Such magnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity and sensibility of a lady who faints when she sees a calf being killed: she is so kindhearted that she can&rsquo;t look at blood, but enjoys eating the calf served up with sauce. They talk to us of the rules of war, of chivalry, of flags of truce, of mercy to the unfortunate and so on. It&rsquo;s all rubbish! I saw chivalry and flags of truce in 1805; they humbugged us and we humbugged them.</p>",
  "page-715": "<p> They plunder other people&rsquo;s houses, issue false paper money, and worst of all they kill my children and my father, and then talk of rules of war and magnanimity to foes! Take no prisoners, but kill and be killed! He who has come to this as I have through the same sufferings...&rdquo;</p><p>Prince Andrew, who had thought it was all the same to him whether or not Moscow was taken as Smolénsk had been, was suddenly checked in his speech by an unexpected cramp in his throat. He paced up and down a few times in silence, but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lips quivered as he began speaking.</p><p>&ldquo;If there was none of this magnanimity in war, we should go to war only when it was worth while going to certain death, as now. Then there would not be war because Paul Ivánovich had offended Michael Ivánovich.</p>",
  "page-716": "<p> And when there was a war, like this one, it would be war! And then the determination of the troops would be quite different. Then all these Westphalians and Hessians whom Napoleon is leading would not follow him into Russia, and we should not go to fight in Austria and Prussia without knowing why. War is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in life; and we ought to understand that and not play at war. We ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously. It all lies in that: get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not a game. As it is now, war is the favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous. The military calling is the most highly honored.</p><p>&ldquo;But what is war? What is needed for success in warfare? What are the habits of the military? The aim of war is murder;</p>",
  "page-717": "<p> the methods of war are spying, treachery, and their encouragement, the ruin of a country&rsquo;s inhabitants, robbing them or stealing to provision the army, and fraud and falsehood termed military craft. The habits of the military class are the absence of freedom, that is, discipline, idleness, ignorance, cruelty, debauchery, and drunkenness. And in spite of all this it is the highest class, respected by everyone. All the kings, except the Chinese, wear military uniforms, and he who kills most people receives the highest rewards.</p><p>&ldquo;They meet, as we shall meet tomorrow, to murder one another; they kill and maim tens of thousands, and then have thanksgiving services for having killed so many people (they even exaggerate the number), and they announce a victory, supposing that the more people they have killed the greater their achievement.</p>",
  "page-718": "<p> How does God above look at them and hear them?&rdquo; exclaimed Prince Andrew in a shrill, piercing voice. &ldquo;Ah, my friend, it has of late become hard for me to live. I see that I have begun to understand too much. And it doesn&rsquo;t do for man to taste of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.... Ah, well, it&rsquo;s not for long!&rdquo; he added.</p><p>&ldquo;However, you&rsquo;re sleepy, and it&rsquo;s time for me to sleep. Go back to Górki!&rdquo; said Prince Andrew suddenly.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; Pierre replied, looking at Prince Andrew with frightened, compassionate eyes.</p>",
  "page-719": "<p>&ldquo;Go, go! Before a battle one must have one&rsquo;s sleep out,&rdquo; repeated Prince Andrew.</p><p>He came quickly up to Pierre and embraced and kissed him. &ldquo;Good-by, be off!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Whether we meet again or not...&rdquo; and turning away hurriedly he entered the shed.</p><p>It was already dark, and Pierre could not make out whether the expression of Prince Andrew&rsquo;s face was angry or tender.</p><p>For some time he stood in silence considering whether he should follow him or go away. &ldquo;No, he does not want it!&rdquo; Pierre concluded. &ldquo;And I know that this is our last meeting!&rdquo; He sighed deeply and rode back to Górki.</p>",
  "page-720": "<p>On re-entering the shed Prince Andrew lay down on a rug, but he could not sleep.</p><p>He closed his eyes. One picture succeeded another in his imagination. On one of them he dwelt long and joyfully. He vividly recalled an evening in Petersburg. Natásha with animated and excited face was telling him how she had gone to look for mushrooms the previous summer and had lost her way in the big forest. She incoherently described the depths of the forest, her feelings, and a talk with a beekeeper she met, and constantly interrupted her story to say: &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;m not telling it right; no, you don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; though he encouraged her by saying that he did understand, and he really had understood all she wanted to say.</p>",
  "page-721": "<p> But Natásha was not satisfied with her own words: she felt that they did not convey the passionately poetic feeling she had experienced that day and wished to convey. &ldquo;He was such a delightful old man, and it was so dark in the forest... and he had such kind... No, I can&rsquo;t describe it,&rdquo; she had said, flushed and excited. Prince Andrew smiled now the same happy smile as then when he had looked into her eyes. &ldquo;I understood her,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I not only understood her, but it was just that inner, spiritual force, that sincerity, that frankness of soul&mdash;that very soul of hers which seemed to be fettered by her body&mdash;it was that soul I loved in her... loved so strongly and happily...&rdquo; and suddenly he remembered how his love had ended. &ldquo;He did not need anything of that kind. He neither saw nor understood anything of the sort.</p>",
  "page-722": "<p> He only saw in her a pretty and fresh young girl, with whom he did not deign to unite his fate. And I?... and he is still alive and gay!&rdquo;</p><p>Prince Andrew jumped up as if someone had burned him, and again began pacing up and down in front of the shed.</p>",

  "page-724": "<p>On August 25, the eve of the battle of Borodinó, M. de Beausset, prefect of the French Emperor&rsquo;s palace, arrived at Napoleon&rsquo;s quarters at Valúevo with Colonel Fabvier, the former from Paris and the latter from Madrid.</p><p>Donning his court uniform, M. de Beausset ordered a box he had brought for the Emperor to be carried before him and entered the first compartment of Napoleon&rsquo;s tent, where he began opening the box while conversing with Napoleon&rsquo;s aides-de-camp who surrounded him.</p><p>Fabvier, not entering the tent, remained at the entrance talking to some generals of his acquaintance.</p><p>The Emperor Napoleon had not yet left his bedroom and was finishing his toilet. Slightly snorting and grunting, he presented now his back and now his plump hairy chest to the brush with which his valet was rubbing him down.</p>",
  "page-725": "<p> Another valet, with his finger over the mouth of a bottle, was sprinkling Eau de Cologne on the Emperor&rsquo;s pampered body with an expression which seemed to say that he alone knew where and how much Eau de Cologne should be sprinkled. Napoleon&rsquo;s short hair was wet and matted on the forehead, but his face, though puffy and yellow, expressed physical satisfaction. &ldquo;Go on, harder, go on!&rdquo; he muttered to the valet who was rubbing him, slightly twitching and grunting. An aide-de-camp, who had entered the bedroom to report to the Emperor the number of prisoners taken in yesterday&rsquo;s action, was standing by the door after delivering his message, awaiting permission to withdraw. Napoleon, frowning, looked at him from under his brows.</p><p>&ldquo;No prisoners!&rdquo; said he, repeating the aide-de-camp&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;They are forcing us to exterminate them.</p>",
  "page-726": "<p> So much the worse for the Russian army.... Go on... harder, harder!&rdquo; he muttered, hunching his back and presenting his fat shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;All right. Let Monsieur de Beausset enter, and Fabvier too,&rdquo; he said, nodding to the aide-de-camp.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sire,&rdquo; and the aide-de-camp disappeared through the door of the tent.</p><p>Two valets rapidly dressed His Majesty, and wearing the blue uniform of the Guards he went with firm quick steps to the reception room.</p><p>De Beausset&rsquo;s hands meanwhile were busily engaged arranging the present he had brought from the Empress, on two chairs directly in front of the entrance. But Napoleon had dressed and come out with such unexpected rapidity that he had not time to finish arranging the surprise.</p>",
  "page-727": "<p>Napoleon noticed at once what they were about and guessed that they were not ready. He did not wish to deprive them of the pleasure of giving him a surprise, so he pretended not to see de Beausset and called Fabvier to him, listening silently and with a stern frown to what Fabvier told him of the heroism and devotion of his troops fighting at Salamanca, at the other end of Europe, with but one thought&mdash;to be worthy of their Emperor&mdash;and but one fear&mdash;to fail to please him. The result of that battle had been deplorable. Napoleon made ironic remarks during Fabvier&rsquo;s account, as if he had not expected that matters could go otherwise in his absence.</p>",
  "page-728": "<p>&ldquo;I must make up for that in Moscow,&rdquo; said Napoleon. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you later,&rdquo; he added, and summoned de Beausset, who by that time had prepared the surprise, having placed something on the chairs and covered it with a cloth.</p><p>De Beausset bowed low, with that courtly French bow which only the old retainers of the Bourbons knew how to make, and approached him, presenting an envelope.</p><p>Napoleon turned to him gaily and pulled his ear.</p><p>&ldquo;You have hurried here. I am very glad. Well, what is Paris saying?&rdquo; he asked, suddenly changing his former stern expression for a most cordial tone.</p>",
  "page-729": "<p>&ldquo;Sire, all Paris regrets your absence,&rdquo; replied de Beausset as was proper.</p><p>But though Napoleon knew that de Beausset had to say something of this kind, and though in his lucid moments he knew it was untrue, he was pleased to hear it from him. Again he honored him by touching his ear.</p><p>&ldquo;I am very sorry to have made you travel so far,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>&ldquo;Sire, I expected nothing less than to find you at the gates of Moscow,&rdquo; replied de Beausset.</p><p>Napoleon smiled and, lifting his head absent-mindedly, glanced to the right. An aide-de-camp approached with gliding steps and offered him a gold snuffbox, which he took.</p>",
  "page-730": "<p>&ldquo;Yes, it has happened luckily for you,&rdquo; he said, raising the open snuffbox to his nose. &ldquo;You are fond of travel, and in three days you will see Moscow. You surely did not expect to see that Asiatic capital. You will have a pleasant journey.&rdquo;</p><p>De Beausset bowed gratefully at this regard for his taste for travel (of which he had not till then been aware).</p><p>&ldquo;Ha, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; asked Napoleon, noticing that all the courtiers were looking at something concealed under a cloth.</p><p>With courtly adroitness de Beausset half turned and without turning his back to the Emperor retired two steps, twitching off the cloth at the same time, and said:</p>",
  "page-731": "<p>&ldquo;A present to Your Majesty from the Empress.&rdquo;</p><p>It was a portrait, painted in bright colors by Gérard, of the son borne to Napoleon by the daughter of the Emperor of Austria, the boy whom for some reason everyone called &ldquo;The King of Rome.&rdquo;</p><p>A very pretty curly-headed boy with a look of the Christ in the Sistine Madonna was depicted playing at stick and ball. The ball represented the terrestrial globe and the stick in his other hand a scepter.</p><p>Though it was not clear what the artist meant to express by depicting the so-called King of Rome spiking the earth with a stick, the allegory apparently seemed to Napoleon, as it had done to all who had seen it in Paris, quite clear and very pleasing.</p>",
  "page-732": "<p>&ldquo;The King of Rome!&rdquo; he said, pointing to the portrait with a graceful gesture. &ldquo;Admirable!&rdquo;</p><p>With the natural capacity of an Italian for changing the expression of his face at will, he drew nearer to the portrait and assumed a look of pensive tenderness. He felt that what he now said and did would be historical, and it seemed to him that it would now be best for him&mdash;whose grandeur enabled his son to play stick and ball with the terrestrial globe&mdash;to show, in contrast to that grandeur, the simplest paternal tenderness. His eyes grew dim, he moved forward, glanced round at a chair (which seemed to place itself under him), and sat down on it before the portrait. At a single gesture from him everyone went out on tiptoe, leaving the great man to himself and his emotion.</p>",
  "page-733": "<p>Having sat still for a while he touched&mdash;himself not knowing why&mdash;the thick spot of paint representing the highest light in the portrait, rose, and recalled de Beausset and the officer on duty. He ordered the portrait to be carried outside his tent, that the Old Guard, stationed round it, might not be deprived of the pleasure of seeing the King of Rome, the son and heir of their adored monarch.</p><p>And while he was doing M. de Beausset the honor of breakfasting with him, they heard, as Napoleon had anticipated, the rapturous cries of the officers and men of the Old Guard who had run up to see the portrait.</p>",
  "page-734": "<p>&ldquo;Vive l&rsquo;Empereur! Vive le roi de Rome! Vive l&rsquo;Empereur!&rdquo; came those ecstatic cries.</p><p>After breakfast Napoleon in de Beausset&rsquo;s presence dictated his order of the day to the army.</p><p>&ldquo;Short and energetic!&rdquo; he remarked when he had read over the proclamation which he had dictated straight off without corrections. It ran:</p><p>Soldiers! This is the battle you have so longed for. Victory depends on you. It is essential for us; it will give us all we need: comfortable quarters and a speedy return to our country. Behave as you did at Austerlitz, Friedland, Vítebsk, and Smolénsk. Let our remotest posterity recall your achievements this day with pride. Let it be said of each of you: &ldquo;He was in the great battle before Moscow!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-735": "<p>&ldquo;Before Moscow!&rdquo; repeated Napoleon, and inviting M. de Beausset, who was so fond of travel, to accompany him on his ride, he went out of the tent to where the horses stood saddled.</p><p>&ldquo;Your Majesty is too kind!&rdquo; replied de Beausset to the invitation to accompany the Emperor; he wanted to sleep, did not know how to ride and was afraid of doing so.</p><p>But Napoleon nodded to the traveler, and de Beausset had to mount. When Napoleon came out of the tent the shouting of the Guards before his son&rsquo;s portrait grew still louder. Napoleon frowned.</p><p>&ldquo;Take him away!&rdquo; he said, pointing with a gracefully majestic gesture to the portrait. &ldquo;It is too soon for him to see a field of battle.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-736": "<p>De Beausset closed his eyes, bowed his head, and sighed deeply, to indicate how profoundly he valued and comprehended the Emperor&rsquo;s words.</p>",
  "page-737": "<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>",
  "page-738": "<p>On the twenty-fifth of August, so his historians tell us, Napoleon spent the whole day on horseback inspecting the locality, considering plans submitted to him by his marshals, and personally giving commands to his generals.</p><p>The original line of the Russian forces along the river Kolochá had been dislocated by the capture of the Shevárdino Redoubt on the twenty-fourth, and part of the line&mdash;the left flank&mdash;had been drawn back. That part of the line was not entrenched and in front of it the ground was more open and level than elsewhere. It was evident to anyone, military or not, that it was here the French should attack. It would seem that not much consideration was needed to reach this conclusion, nor any particular care or trouble on the part of the Emperor and his marshals, nor was there any need of that special and supreme quality called genius that people are so apt to ascribe to Napoleon;</p>",
  "page-739": "<p> yet the historians who described the event later and the men who then surrounded Napoleon, and he himself, thought otherwise.</p><p>Napoleon rode over the plain and surveyed the locality with a profound air and in silence, nodded with approval or shook his head dubiously, and without communicating to the generals around him the profound course of ideas which guided his decisions merely gave them his final conclusions in the form of commands. Having listened to a suggestion from Davout, who was now called Prince d&rsquo;Eckmühl, to turn the Russian left wing, Napoleon said it should not be done, without explaining why not. To a proposal made by General Campan (who was to attack the flèches) to lead his division through the woods, Napoleon agreed, though the so-called Duke of Elchingen (Ney) ventured to remark that a movement through the woods was dangerous and might disorder the division.</p>",
  "page-740": "<p>Having inspected the country opposite the Shevárdino Redoubt, Napoleon pondered a little in silence and then indicated the spots where two batteries should be set up by the morrow to act against the Russian entrenchments, and the places where, in line with them, the field artillery should be placed.</p><p>After giving these and other commands he returned to his tent, and the dispositions for the battle were written down from his dictation.</p><p>These dispositions, of which the French historians write with enthusiasm and other historians with profound respect, were as follows:</p><p>At dawn the two new batteries established during the night on the plain occupied by the Prince d&rsquo;Eckmühl will open fire on the opposing batteries of the enemy.</p>",
  "page-741": "<p>At the same time the commander of the artillery of the 1st Corps, General Pernetti, with thirty cannon of Campan&rsquo;s division and all the howitzers of Dessaix&rsquo;s and Friant&rsquo;s divisions, will move forward, open fire, and overwhelm with shellfire the enemy&rsquo;s battery, against which will operate:</p><p>The commander of the artillery of the 3rd Corps, General Fouché, will place the howitzers of the 3rd and 8th Corps, sixteen in all, on the flanks of the battery that is to bombard the entrenchment on the left, which will have forty guns in all directed against it.</p><p>General Sorbier must be ready at the first order to advance with all the howitzers of the Guard&rsquo;s artillery against either one or other of the entrenchments.</p>",
  "page-742": "<p>During the cannonade Prince Poniatowski is to advance through the wood on the village and turn the enemy&rsquo;s position.</p><p>General Campan will move through the wood to seize the first fortification.</p><p>After the advance has begun in this manner, orders will be given in accordance with the enemy&rsquo;s movements.</p><p>The cannonade on the left flank will begin as soon as the guns of the right wing are heard. The sharpshooters of Morand&rsquo;s division and of the vice-King&rsquo;s division will open a heavy fire on seeing the attack commence on the right wing.</p>",
  "page-743": "<p>The vice-King will occupy the village and cross by its three bridges, advancing to the same heights as Morand&rsquo;s and Gibrard&rsquo;s divisions, which under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt and come into line with the rest of the forces.</p><p>All this must be done in good order (le tout se fera avec ordre et méthode) as far as possible retaining troops in reserve.</p><p>The Imperial Camp near Mozháysk,</p><p>September, 6, 1812.</p><p>These dispositions, which are very obscure and confused if one allows oneself to regard the arrangements without religious awe of his genius, related to Napoleon&rsquo;s orders to deal with four points&mdash;four different orders. Not one of these was, or could be, carried out.</p>",
  "page-744": "<p>In the disposition it is said first that the batteries placed on the spot chosen by Napoleon, with the guns of Pernetti and Fouché; which were to come in line with them, 102 guns in all, were to open fire and shower shells on the Russian flèches and redoubts. This could not be done, as from the spots selected by Napoleon the projectiles did not carry to the Russian works, and those 102 guns shot into the air until the nearest commander, contrary to Napoleon&rsquo;s instructions, moved them forward.</p><p>The second order was that Poniatowski, moving to the village through the wood, should turn the Russian left flank. This could not be done and was not done, because Poniatowski, advancing on the village through the wood, met Túchkov there barring his way, and could not and did not turn the Russian position.</p>",
  "page-745": "<p>The third order was: General Campan will move through the wood to seize the first fortification. General Campan&rsquo;s division did not seize the first fortification but was driven back, for on emerging from the wood it had to reform under grapeshot, of which Napoleon was unaware.</p><p>The fourth order was: The vice-King will occupy the village (Borodinó) and cross by its three bridges, advancing to the same heights as Morand&rsquo;s and Gérard&rsquo;s divisions (for whose movements no directions are given), which under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt and come into line with the rest of the forces.</p><p>As far as one can make out, not so much from this unintelligible sentence as from the attempts the vice-King made to execute the orders given him, he was to advance from the left through Borodinó to the redoubt while the divisions of Morand and Gérard were to advance simultaneously from the front.</p>",
  "page-746": "<p>All this, like the other parts of the disposition, was not and could not be executed. After passing through Borodinó the vice-King was driven back to the Kolochá and could get no farther; while the divisions of Morand and Gérard did not take the redoubt but were driven back, and the redoubt was only taken at the end of the battle by the cavalry (a thing probably unforeseen and not heard of by Napoleon). So not one of the orders in the disposition was, or could be, executed. But in the disposition it is said that, after the fight has commenced in this manner, orders will be given in accordance with the enemy&rsquo;s movements, and so it might be supposed that all necessary arrangements would be made by Napoleon during the battle.</p>",
  "page-747": "<p> But this was not and could not be done, for during the whole battle Napoleon was so far away that, as appeared later, he could not know the course of the battle and not one of his orders during the fight could be executed.</p>",
  "page-748": "<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>",
  "page-749": "<p>Many historians say that the French did not win the battle of Borodinó because Napoleon had a cold, and that if he had not had a cold the orders he gave before and during the battle would have been still more full of genius and Russia would have been lost and the face of the world have been changed. To historians who believe that Russia was shaped by the will of one man&mdash;Peter the Great&mdash;and that France from a republic became an empire and French armies went to Russia at the will of one man&mdash;Napoleon&mdash;to say that Russia remained a power because Napoleon had a bad cold on the twenty-fourth of August may seem logical and convincing.</p>",
  "page-750": "<p>If it had depended on Napoleon&rsquo;s will to fight or not to fight the battle of Borodinó, and if this or that other arrangement depended on his will, then evidently a cold affecting the manifestation of his will might have saved Russia, and consequently the valet who omitted to bring Napoleon his waterproof boots on the twenty-fourth would have been the savior of Russia. Along that line of thought such a deduction is indubitable, as indubitable as the deduction Voltaire made in jest (without knowing what he was jesting at) when he saw that the Massacre of St. Bartholomew was due to Charles IX&rsquo;s stomach being deranged. But to men who do not admit that Russia was formed by the will of one man, Peter I, or that the French Empire was formed and the war with Russia begun by the will of one man, Napoleon, that argument seems not merely untrue and irrational, but contrary to all human reality.</p>",
  "page-751": "<p> To the question of what causes historic events another answer presents itself, namely, that the course of human events is predetermined from on high&mdash;depends on the coincidence of the wills of all who take part in the events, and that a Napoleon&rsquo;s influence on the course of these events is purely external and fictitious.</p><p>Strange as at first glance it may seem to suppose that the Massacre of St. Bartholomew was not due to Charles IX&rsquo;s will, though he gave the order for it and thought it was done as a result of that order; and strange as it may seem to suppose that the slaughter of eighty thousand men at Borodinó was not due to Napoleon&rsquo;s will, though he ordered the commencement and conduct of the battle and thought it was done because he ordered it; strange as these suppositions appear, yet human dignity&mdash;</p>",
  "page-752": "<p>which tells me that each of us is, if not more at least not less a man than the great Napoleon&mdash;demands the acceptance of that solution of the question, and historic investigation abundantly confirms it.</p><p>At the battle of Borodinó Napoleon shot at no one and killed no one. That was all done by the soldiers. Therefore it was not he who killed people.</p><p>The French soldiers went to kill and be killed at the battle of Borodinó not because of Napoleon&rsquo;s orders but by their own volition. The whole army&mdash;French, Italian, German, Polish, and Dutch&mdash;hungry, ragged, and weary of the campaign, felt at the sight of an army blocking their road to Moscow that the wine was drawn and must be drunk. Had Napoleon then forbidden them to fight the Russians, they would have killed him and have proceeded to fight the Russians because it was inevitable.</p>",
  "page-753": "<p>When they heard Napoleon&rsquo;s proclamation offering them, as compensation for mutilation and death, the words of posterity about their having been in the battle before Moscow, they cried &ldquo;Vive l&rsquo;Empereur!&rdquo; just as they had cried &ldquo;Vive l&rsquo;Empereur!&rdquo; at the sight of the portrait of the boy piercing the terrestrial globe with a toy stick, and just as they would have cried &ldquo;Vive l&rsquo;Empereur!&rdquo; at any nonsense that might be told them. There was nothing left for them to do but cry &ldquo;Vive l&rsquo;Empereur!&rdquo; and go to fight, in order to get food and rest as conquerors in Moscow. So it was not because of Napoleon&rsquo;s commands that they killed their fellow men.</p>",
  "page-754": "<p>And it was not Napoleon who directed the course of the battle, for none of his orders were executed and during the battle he did not know what was going on before him. So the way in which these people killed one another was not decided by Napoleon&rsquo;s will but occurred independently of him, in accord with the will of hundreds of thousands of people who took part in the common action. It only seemed to Napoleon that it all took place by his will. And so the question whether he had or had not a cold has no more historic interest than the cold of the least of the transport soldiers.</p><p>Moreover, the assertion made by various writers that his cold was the cause of his dispositions not being as well-planned as on former occasions, and of his orders during the battle not being as good as previously, is quite baseless, which again shows that Napoleon&rsquo;s cold on the twenty-sixth of August was unimportant.</p>",
  "page-755": "<p>The dispositions cited above are not at all worse, but are even better, than previous dispositions by which he had won victories. His pseudo-orders during the battle were also no worse than formerly, but much the same as usual. These dispositions and orders only seem worse than previous ones because the battle of Borodinó was the first Napoleon did not win. The profoundest and most excellent dispositions and orders seem very bad, and every learned militarist criticizes them with looks of importance, when they relate to a battle that has been lost, and the very worst dispositions and orders seem very good, and serious people fill whole volumes to demonstrate their merits, when they relate to a battle that has been won.</p>",
  "page-756": "<p>The dispositions drawn up by Weyrother for the battle of Austerlitz were a model of perfection for that kind of composition, but still they were criticized&mdash;criticized for their very perfection, for their excessive minuteness.</p><p>Napoleon at the battle of Borodinó fulfilled his office as representative of authority as well as, and even better than, at other battles. He did nothing harmful to the progress of the battle; he inclined to the most reasonable opinions, he made no confusion, did not contradict himself, did not get frightened or run away from the field of battle, but with his great tact and military experience carried out his role of appearing to command, calmly and with dignity.</p>",
  "page-757": "<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>",
  "page-758": "<p>On returning from a second inspection of the lines, Napoleon remarked:</p><p>&ldquo;The chessmen are set up, the game will begin tomorrow!&rdquo;</p><p>Having ordered punch and summoned de Beausset, he began to talk to him about Paris and about some changes he meant to make in the Empress&rsquo; household, surprising the prefect by his memory of minute details relating to the court.</p><p>He showed an interest in trifles, joked about de Beausset&rsquo;s love of travel, and chatted carelessly, as a famous, self-confident surgeon who knows his job does when turning up his sleeves and putting on his apron while a patient is being strapped to the operating table. &ldquo;The matter is in my hands and is clear and definite in my head.</p>",
  "page-759": "<p> When the time comes to set to work I shall do it as no one else could, but now I can jest, and the more I jest and the calmer I am the more tranquil and confident you ought to be, and the more amazed at my genius.&rdquo;</p><p>Having finished his second glass of punch, Napoleon went to rest before the serious business which, he considered, awaited him next day. He was so much interested in that task that he was unable to sleep, and in spite of his cold which had grown worse from the dampness of the evening, he went into the large division of the tent at three o&rsquo;clock in the morning, loudly blowing his nose. He asked whether the Russians had not withdrawn, and was told that the enemy&rsquo;s fires were still in the same places. He nodded approval.</p>",
  "page-760": "<p>The adjutant in attendance came into the tent.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, Rapp, do you think we shall do good business today?&rdquo; Napoleon asked him.</p><p>&ldquo;Without doubt, sire,&rdquo; replied Rapp.</p><p>Napoleon looked at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you remember, sire, what you did me the honor to say at Smolénsk?&rdquo; continued Rapp. &ldquo;The wine is drawn and must be drunk.&rdquo;</p><p>Napoleon frowned and sat silent for a long time leaning his head on his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;This poor army!&rdquo; he suddenly remarked. &ldquo;It has diminished greatly since Smolénsk. Fortune is frankly a courtesan, Rapp. I have always said so and I am beginning to experience it. But the Guards, Rapp, the Guards are intact?&rdquo; he remarked interrogatively.</p>",
  "page-761": "<p>&ldquo;Yes, sire,&rdquo; replied Rapp.</p><p>Napoleon took a lozenge, put it in his mouth, and glanced at his watch. He was not sleepy and it was still not nearly morning. It was impossible to give further orders for the sake of killing time, for the orders had all been given and were now being executed.</p><p>&ldquo;Have the biscuits and rice been served out to the regiments of the Guards?&rdquo; asked Napoleon sternly.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The rice too?&rdquo;</p><p>Rapp replied that he had given the Emperor&rsquo;s order about the rice, but Napoleon shook his head in dissatisfaction as if not believing that his order had been executed. An attendant came in with punch. Napoleon ordered another glass to be brought for Rapp, and silently sipped his own.</p>",
  "page-762": "<p>&ldquo;I have neither taste nor smell,&rdquo; he remarked, sniffing at his glass. &ldquo;This cold is tiresome. They talk about medicine&mdash;what is the good of medicine when it can&rsquo;t cure a cold! Corvisart gave me these lozenges but they don&rsquo;t help at all. What can doctors cure? One can&rsquo;t cure anything. Our body is a machine for living. It is organized for that, it is its nature. Let life go on in it unhindered and let it defend itself, it will do more than if you paralyze it by encumbering it with remedies. Our body is like a perfect watch that should go for a certain time; the watchmaker cannot open it, he can only adjust it by fumbling, and that blindfold.... Yes, our body is just a machine for living, that is all.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-763": "<p>And having entered on the path of definition, of which he was fond, Napoleon suddenly and unexpectedly gave a new one.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know, Rapp, what military art is?&rdquo; asked he. &ldquo;It is the art of being stronger than the enemy at a given moment. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p><p>Rapp made no reply.</p><p>&ldquo;Tomorrow we shall have to deal with Kutúzov!&rdquo; said Napoleon. &ldquo;We shall see! Do you remember at Braunau he commanded an army for three weeks and did not once mount a horse to inspect his entrenchments.... We shall see!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-764": "<p>He looked at his watch. It was still only four o&rsquo;clock. He did not feel sleepy. The punch was finished and there was still nothing to do. He rose, walked to and fro, put on a warm overcoat and a hat, and went out of the tent. The night was dark and damp, a scarcely perceptible moisture was descending from above. Near by, the campfires were dimly burning among the French Guards, and in the distance those of the Russian line shone through the smoke. The weather was calm, and the rustle and tramp of the French troops already beginning to move to take up their positions were clearly audible.</p><p>Napoleon walked about in front of his tent, looked at the fires and listened to these sounds, and as he was passing a tall guardsman in a shaggy cap, who was standing sentinel before his tent and had drawn himself up like a black pillar at sight of the Emperor, Napoleon stopped in front of him.</p>",
  "page-765": "<p>&ldquo;What year did you enter the service?&rdquo; he asked with that affectation of military bluntness and geniality with which he always addressed the soldiers.</p><p>The man answered the question.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! One of the old ones! Has your regiment had its rice?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It has, Your Majesty.&rdquo;</p><p>Napoleon nodded and walked away.</p><p>At half-past five Napoleon rode to the village of Shevárdino.</p><p>It was growing light, the sky was clearing, only a single cloud lay in the east. The abandoned campfires were burning themselves out in the faint morning light.</p>",
  "page-766": "<p>On the right a single deep report of a cannon resounded and died away in the prevailing silence. Some minutes passed. A second and a third report shook the air, then a fourth and a fifth boomed solemnly near by on the right.</p><p>The first shots had not yet ceased to reverberate before others rang out and yet more were heard mingling with and overtaking one another.</p><p>Napoleon with his suite rode up to the Shevárdino Redoubt where he dismounted. The game had begun.</p>",
  "page-767": "<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>",
  "page-768": "<p>On returning to Górki after having seen Prince Andrew, Pierre ordered his groom to get the horses ready and to call him early in the morning, and then immediately fell asleep behind a partition in a corner Borís had given up to him.</p><p>Before he was thoroughly awake next morning everybody had already left the hut. The panes were rattling in the little windows and his groom was shaking him.</p><p>&ldquo;Your excellency! Your excellency! Your excellency!&rdquo; he kept repeating pertinaciously while he shook Pierre by the shoulder without looking at him, having apparently lost hope of getting him to wake up.</p><p>&ldquo;What? Has it begun? Is it time?&rdquo; Pierre asked, waking up.</p>",
  "page-769": "<p>&ldquo;Hear the firing,&rdquo; said the groom, a discharged soldier. &ldquo;All the gentlemen have gone out, and his Serene Highness himself rode past long ago.&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre dressed hastily and ran out to the porch. Outside all was bright, fresh, dewy, and cheerful. The sun, just bursting forth from behind a cloud that had concealed it, was shining, with rays still half broken by the clouds, over the roofs of the street opposite, on the dew-besprinkled dust of the road, on the walls of the houses, on the windows, the fence, and on Pierre&rsquo;s horses standing before the hut. The roar of guns sounded more distinct outside. An adjutant accompanied by a Cossack passed by at a sharp trot.</p>",
  "page-770": "<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time, Count; it&rsquo;s time!&rdquo; cried the adjutant.</p><p>Telling the groom to follow him with the horses, Pierre went down the street to the knoll from which he had looked at the field of battle the day before. A crowd of military men was assembled there, members of the staff could be heard conversing in French, and Kutúzov&rsquo;s gray head in a white cap with a red band was visible, his gray nape sunk between his shoulders. He was looking through a field glass down the highroad before him.</p><p>Mounting the steps to the knoll Pierre looked at the scene before him, spellbound by beauty. It was the same panorama he had admired from that spot the day before, but now the whole place was full of troops and covered by smoke clouds from the guns, and the slanting rays of the bright sun, rising</p>",
  "page-771": "<p>slightly to the left behind Pierre, cast upon it through the clear morning air penetrating streaks of rosy, golden-tinted light and long dark shadows. The forest at the farthest extremity of the panorama seemed carved in some precious stone of a yellowish-green color; its undulating outline was silhouetted against the horizon and was pierced beyond Valúevo by the Smolénsk highroad crowded with troops. Nearer at hand glittered golden cornfields interspersed with copses. There were troops to be seen everywhere, in front and to the right and left. All this was vivid, majestic, and unexpected; but what impressed Pierre most of all was the view of the battlefield itself, of Borodinó and the hollows on both sides of the Kolochá.</p><p>Above the Kolochá, in Borodinó and on both sides of it, especially to the left where the Vóyna flowing between its marshy banks falls into the Kolochá, a mist had spread</p>",
  "page-772": "<p>which seemed to melt, to dissolve, and to become translucent when the brilliant sun appeared and magically colored and outlined everything. The smoke of the guns mingled with this mist, and over the whole expanse and through that mist the rays of the morning sun were reflected, flashing back like lightning from the water, from the dew, and from the bayonets of the troops crowded together by the riverbanks and in Borodinó. A white church could be seen through the mist, and here and there the roofs of huts in Borodinó as well as dense masses of soldiers, or green ammunition chests and ordnance. And all this moved, or seemed to move, as the smoke and mist spread out over the whole space.</p>",
  "page-773": "<p> Just as in the mist-enveloped hollow near Borodinó, so along the entire line outside and above it and especially in the woods and fields to the left, in the valleys and on the summits of the high ground, clouds of powder smoke seemed continually to spring up out of nothing, now singly, now several at a time, some translucent, others dense, which, swelling, growing, rolling, and blending, extended over the whole expanse.</p><p>These puffs of smoke and (strange to say) the sound of the firing produced the chief beauty of the spectacle.</p><p>&ldquo;Puff!&rdquo;&mdash;suddenly a round compact cloud of smoke was seen merging from violet into gray and milky white, and &ldquo;boom!&rdquo; came the report a second later.</p>",
  "page-774": "<p>&ldquo;Puff! puff!&rdquo;&mdash;and two clouds arose pushing one another and blending together; and &ldquo;boom, boom!&rdquo; came the sounds confirming what the eye had seen.</p><p>Pierre glanced round at the first cloud, which he had seen as a round compact ball, and in its place already were balloons of smoke floating to one side, and&mdash;&ldquo;puff&rdquo; (with a pause)&mdash;&ldquo;puff, puff!&rdquo; three and then four more appeared and then from each, with the same interval&mdash;&ldquo;boom&mdash;boom, boom!&rdquo; came the fine, firm, precise sounds in reply. It seemed as if those smoke clouds sometimes ran and sometimes stood still while woods, fields, and glittering bayonets ran past them. From the left, over fields and bushes, those large balls of smoke were continually appearing followed by their solemn reports, while nearer still, in the hollows and woods, there burst from the muskets small cloudlets that had no time to become balls, but had their little echoes in just the same way.</p>",
  "page-775": "<p> &ldquo;Trakh-ta-ta-takh!&rdquo; came the frequent crackle of musketry, but it was irregular and feeble in comparison with the reports of the cannon.</p><p>Pierre wished to be there with that smoke, those shining bayonets, that movement, and those sounds. He turned to look at Kutúzov and his suite, to compare his impressions with those of others. They were all looking at the field of battle as he was, and, as it seemed to him, with the same feelings. All their faces were now shining with that latent warmth of feeling Pierre had noticed the day before and had fully understood after his talk with Prince Andrew.</p><p>&ldquo;Go, my dear fellow, go... and Christ be with you!&rdquo; Kutúzov was saying to a general who stood beside him, not taking his eye from the battlefield.</p>",
  "page-776": "<p>Having received this order the general passed by Pierre on his way down the knoll.</p><p>&ldquo;To the crossing!&rdquo; said the general coldly and sternly in reply to one of the staff who asked where he was going.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go there too, I too!&rdquo; thought Pierre, and followed the general.</p><p>The general mounted a horse a Cossack had brought him. Pierre went to his groom who was holding his horses and, asking which was the quietest, clambered onto it, seized it by the mane, and turning out his toes pressed his heels against its sides and, feeling that his spectacles were slipping off but unable to let go of the mane and reins, he galloped after the general, causing the staff officers to smile as they watched him from the knoll.</p>",
  "page-777": "<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>",
  "page-778": "<p>Having descended the hill the general after whom Pierre was galloping turned sharply to the left, and Pierre, losing sight of him, galloped in among some ranks of infantry marching ahead of him. He tried to pass either in front of them or to the right or left, but there were soldiers everywhere, all with the same preoccupied expression and busy with some unseen but evidently important task. They all gazed with the same dissatisfied and inquiring expression at this stout man in a white hat, who for some unknown reason threatened to trample them under his horse&rsquo;s hoofs.</p><p>&ldquo;Why ride into the middle of the battalion?&rdquo; one of them shouted at him.</p><p>Another prodded his horse with the butt end of a musket, and Pierre, bending over his saddlebow and hardly able to control his shying horse, galloped ahead of the soldiers where there was a free space.</p>",
  "page-779": "<p>There was a bridge ahead of him, where other soldiers stood firing. Pierre rode up to them. Without being aware of it he had come to the bridge across the Kolochá between Górki and Borodinó, which the French (having occupied Borodinó) were attacking in the first phase of the battle. Pierre saw that there was a bridge in front of him and that soldiers were doing something on both sides of it and in the meadow, among the rows of new-mown hay which he had taken no notice of amid the smoke of the campfires the day before; but despite the incessant firing going on there he had no idea that this was the field of battle. He did not notice the sound of the bullets whistling from every side, or the projectiles that flew over him, did not see the enemy on the other side of the river, and for a long time did not notice the killed and wounded, though many fell near him. He looked about him with a smile which did not leave his face.</p>",
  "page-780": "<p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;s that fellow in front of the line?&rdquo; shouted somebody at him again.</p><p>&ldquo;To the left!... Keep to the right!&rdquo; the men shouted to him.</p><p>Pierre went to the right, and unexpectedly encountered one of Raévski&rsquo;s adjutants whom he knew. The adjutant looked angrily at him, evidently also intending to shout at him, but on recognizing him he nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;How have you got here?&rdquo; he said, and galloped on.</p><p>Pierre, feeling out of place there, having nothing to do, and afraid of getting in someone&rsquo;s way again, galloped after the adjutant.</p>",
  "page-781": "<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening here? May I come with you?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;One moment, one moment!&rdquo; replied the adjutant, and riding up to a stout colonel who was standing in the meadow, he gave him some message and then addressed Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;Why have you come here, Count?&rdquo; he asked with a smile. &ldquo;Still inquisitive?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; assented Pierre.</p><p>But the adjutant turned his horse about and rode on.</p><p>&ldquo;Here it&rsquo;s tolerable,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but with Bagratión on the left flank they&rsquo;re getting it frightfully hot.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-782": "<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said Pierre. &ldquo;Where is that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come along with me to our knoll. We can get a view from there and in our battery it is still bearable,&rdquo; said the adjutant. &ldquo;Will you come?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll come with you,&rdquo; replied Pierre, looking round for his groom.</p><p>It was only now that he noticed wounded men staggering along or being carried on stretchers. On that very meadow he had ridden over the day before, a soldier was lying athwart the rows of scented hay, with his head thrown awkwardly back and his shako off.</p>",
  "page-783": "<p>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t they carried him away?&rdquo; Pierre was about to ask, but seeing the stern expression of the adjutant who was also looking that way, he checked himself.</p><p>Pierre did not find his groom and rode along the hollow with the adjutant to Raévski&rsquo;s Redoubt. His horse lagged behind the adjutant&rsquo;s and jolted him at every step.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to be used to riding, Count?&rdquo; remarked the adjutant.</p><p>&ldquo;No it&rsquo;s not that, but her action seems so jerky,&rdquo; said Pierre in a puzzled tone.</p>",
  "page-784": "<p>&ldquo;Why... she&rsquo;s wounded!&rdquo; said the adjutant. &ldquo;In the off foreleg above the knee. A bullet, no doubt. I congratulate you, Count, on your baptism of fire!&rdquo;</p><p>Having ridden in the smoke past the Sixth Corps, behind the artillery which had been moved forward and was in action, deafening them with the noise of firing, they came to a small wood. There it was cool and quiet, with a scent of autumn. Pierre and the adjutant dismounted and walked up the hill on foot.</p><p>&ldquo;Is the general here?&rdquo; asked the adjutant on reaching the knoll.</p><p>&ldquo;He was here a minute ago but has just gone that way,&rdquo; someone told him, pointing to the right.</p>",
  "page-785": "<p>The adjutant looked at Pierre as if puzzled what to do with him now.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble about me,&rdquo; said Pierre. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go up onto the knoll if I may?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, do. You&rsquo;ll see everything from there and it&rsquo;s less dangerous, and I&rsquo;ll come for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre went to the battery and the adjutant rode on. They did not meet again, and only much later did Pierre learn that he lost an arm that day.</p><p>The knoll to which Pierre ascended was that famous one afterwards known to the Russians as the Knoll Battery or Raévski&rsquo;s Redoubt, and to the French as la grande redoute, la fatale redoute, la redoute du centre, around which tens of thousands fell, and which the French regarded as the key to the whole position.</p>",
  "page-786": "<p>This redoubt consisted of a knoll, on three sides of which trenches had been dug. Within the entrenchment stood ten guns that were being fired through openings in the earthwork.</p><p>In line with the knoll on both sides stood other guns which also fired incessantly. A little behind the guns stood infantry. When ascending that knoll Pierre had no notion that this spot, on which small trenches had been dug and from which a few guns were firing, was the most important point of the battle.</p><p>On the contrary, just because he happened to be there he thought it one of the least significant parts of the field.</p><p>Having reached the knoll, Pierre sat down at one end of a trench surrounding the battery and gazed at what was going on around him with an unconsciously happy smile.</p>",
  "page-787": "<p> Occasionally he rose and walked about the battery still with that same smile, trying not to obstruct the soldiers who were loading, hauling the guns, and continually running past him with bags and charges. The guns of that battery were being fired continually one after another with a deafening roar, enveloping the whole neighborhood in powder smoke.</p><p>In contrast with the dread felt by the infantrymen placed in support, here in the battery where a small number of men busy at their work were separated from the rest by a trench, everyone experienced a common and as it were family feeling of animation.</p><p>The intrusion of Pierre&rsquo;s nonmilitary figure in a white hat made an unpleasant impression at first. The soldiers looked askance at him with surprise and even alarm as they went past him.</p>",
  "page-788": "<p> The senior artillery officer, a tall, long-legged, pockmarked man, moved over to Pierre as if to see the action of the farthest gun and looked at him with curiosity.</p><p>A young round-faced officer, quite a boy still and evidently only just out of the Cadet College, who was zealously commanding the two guns entrusted to him, addressed Pierre sternly.</p><p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;permit me to ask you to stand aside. You must not be here.&rdquo;</p><p>The soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly as they looked at Pierre. But when they had convinced themselves that this man in the white hat was doing no harm, but either sat quietly on the slope of the trench with a shy smile or, politely making way for the soldiers, paced up and down the battery under fire as calmly as if he were on a boulevard, their feeling of hostile distrust gradually began</p>",
  "page-789": "<p>to change into a kindly and bantering sympathy, such as soldiers feel for their dogs, cocks, goats, and in general for the animals that live with the regiment. The men soon accepted Pierre into their family, adopted him, gave him a nickname (&ldquo;our gentleman&rdquo;), and made kindly fun of him among themselves.</p><p>A shell tore up the earth two paces from Pierre and he looked around with a smile as he brushed from his clothes some earth it had thrown up.</p><p>&ldquo;And how&rsquo;s it you&rsquo;re not afraid, sir, really now?&rdquo; a red-faced, broad-shouldered soldier asked Pierre, with a grin that disclosed a set of sound, white teeth.</p>",
  "page-790": "<p>&ldquo;Are you afraid, then?&rdquo; said Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;What else do you expect?&rdquo; answered the soldier. &ldquo;She has no mercy, you know! When she comes spluttering down, out go your innards. One can&rsquo;t help being afraid,&rdquo; he said laughing.</p><p>Several of the men, with bright kindly faces, stopped beside Pierre. They seemed not to have expected him to talk like anybody else, and the discovery that he did so delighted them.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the business of us soldiers. But in a gentleman it&rsquo;s wonderful! There&rsquo;s a gentleman for you!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-791": "<p>&ldquo;To your places!&rdquo; cried the young officer to the men gathered round Pierre.</p><p>The young officer was evidently exercising his duties for the first or second time and therefore treated both his superiors and the men with great precision and formality.</p><p>The booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were growing more intense over the whole field, especially to the left where Bagratión&rsquo;s flèches were, but where Pierre was the smoke of the firing made it almost impossible to distinguish anything. Moreover, his whole attention was engrossed by watching the family circle&mdash;separated from all else&mdash;formed by the men in the battery. His first unconscious feeling of joyful animation produced by the sights and sounds of the battlefield was now replaced by another, especially since he had seen that soldier lying alone in the hayfield. Now, seated on the slope of the trench, he observed the faces of those around him.</p>",
  "page-792": "<p>By ten o&rsquo;clock some twenty men had already been carried away from the battery; two guns were smashed and cannon balls fell more and more frequently on the battery and spent bullets buzzed and whistled around. But the men in the battery seemed not to notice this, and merry voices and jokes were heard on all sides.</p><p>&ldquo;A live one!&rdquo; shouted a man as a whistling shell approached.</p><p>&ldquo;Not this way! To the infantry!&rdquo; added another with loud laughter, seeing the shell fly past and fall into the ranks of the supports.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you bowing to a friend, eh?&rdquo; remarked another, chaffing a peasant who ducked low as a cannon ball flew over.</p>",
  "page-793": "<p>Several soldiers gathered by the wall of the trench, looking out to see what was happening in front.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve withdrawn the front line, it has retired,&rdquo; said they, pointing over the earthwork.</p><p>&ldquo;Mind your own business,&rdquo; an old sergeant shouted at them. &ldquo;If they&rsquo;ve retired it&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s work for them to do farther back.&rdquo;</p><p>And the sergeant, taking one of the men by the shoulders, gave him a shove with his knee. This was followed by a burst of laughter.</p>",
  "page-794": "<p>&ldquo;To the fifth gun, wheel it up!&rdquo; came shouts from one side.</p><p>&ldquo;Now then, all together, like bargees!&rdquo; rose the merry voices of those who were moving the gun.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, she nearly knocked our gentleman&rsquo;s hat off!&rdquo; cried the red-faced humorist, showing his teeth chaffing Pierre. &ldquo;Awkward baggage!&rdquo; he added reproachfully to a cannon ball that struck a cannon wheel and a man&rsquo;s leg.</p><p>&ldquo;Now then, you foxes!&rdquo; said another, laughing at some militiamen who, stooping low, entered the battery to carry away the wounded man.</p><p>&ldquo;So this gruel isn&rsquo;t to your taste? Oh, you crows! You&rsquo;re scared!&rdquo; they shouted at the militiamen who stood hesitating before the man whose leg had been torn off.</p>",
  "page-795": "<p>&ldquo;There, lads... oh, oh!&rdquo; they mimicked the peasants, &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t like it at all!&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre noticed that after every ball that hit the redoubt, and after every loss, the liveliness increased more and more.</p><p>As the flames of the fire hidden within come more and more vividly and rapidly from an approaching thundercloud, so, as if in opposition to what was taking place, the lightning of hidden fire growing more and more intense glowed in the faces of these men.</p><p>Pierre did not look out at the battlefield and was not concerned to know what was happening there; he was entirely absorbed in watching this fire which burned ever more brightly and which he felt was flaming up in the same way in his own soul.</p>",
  "page-796": "<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock the infantry that had been among the bushes in front of the battery and along the Kámenka streamlet retreated. From the battery they could be seen running back past it carrying their wounded on their muskets. A general with his suite came to the battery, and after speaking to the colonel gave Pierre an angry look and went away again having ordered the infantry supports behind the battery to lie down, so as to be less exposed to fire. After this from amid the ranks of infantry to the right of the battery came the sound of a drum and shouts of command, and from the battery one saw how those ranks of infantry moved forward.</p><p>Pierre looked over the wall of the trench and was particularly struck by a pale young officer who, letting his sword hang down, was walking backwards and kept glancing uneasily around.</p>",
  "page-797": "<p>The ranks of the infantry disappeared amid the smoke but their long-drawn shout and rapid musketry firing could still be heard. A few minutes later crowds of wounded men and stretcher-bearers came back from that direction. Projectiles began to fall still more frequently in the battery. Several men were lying about who had not been removed. Around the cannon the men moved still more briskly and busily. No one any longer took notice of Pierre. Once or twice he was shouted at for being in the way. The senior officer moved with big, rapid strides from one gun to another with a frowning face. The young officer, with his face still more flushed, commanded the men more scrupulously than ever. The soldiers handed up the charges, turned, loaded, and did their business with strained smartness. They gave little jumps as they walked, as though they were on springs.</p>",
  "page-798": "<p>The stormcloud had come upon them, and in every face the fire which Pierre had watched kindle burned up brightly. Pierre standing beside the commanding officer. The young officer, his hand to his shako, ran up to his superior.</p><p>&ldquo;I have the honor to report, sir, that only eight rounds are left. Are we to continue firing?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Grapeshot!&rdquo; the senior shouted, without answering the question, looking over the wall of the trench.</p><p>Suddenly something happened: the young officer gave a gasp and bending double sat down on the ground like a bird shot on the wing. Everything became strange, confused, and misty in Pierre&rsquo;s eyes.</p>",
  "page-799": "<p>One cannon ball after another whistled by and struck the earthwork, a soldier, or a gun. Pierre, who had not noticed these sounds before, now heard nothing else. On the right of the battery soldiers shouting &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; were running not forwards but backwards, it seemed to Pierre.</p><p>A cannon ball struck the very end of the earth work by which he was standing, crumbling down the earth; a black ball flashed before his eyes and at the same instant plumped into something. Some militiamen who were entering the battery ran back.</p><p>&ldquo;All with grapeshot!&rdquo; shouted the officer.</p><p>The sergeant ran up to the officer and in a frightened whisper informed him (as a butler at dinner informs his master that there is no more of some wine asked for) that there were no more charges.</p>",
  "page-800": "<p>&ldquo;The scoundrels! What are they doing?&rdquo; shouted the officer, turning to Pierre.</p><p>The officer&rsquo;s face was red and perspiring and his eyes glittered under his frowning brow.</p><p>&ldquo;Run to the reserves and bring up the ammunition boxes!&rdquo; he yelled, angrily avoiding Pierre with his eyes and speaking to his men.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; said Pierre.</p><p>The officer, without answering him, strode across to the opposite side.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fire.... Wait!&rdquo; he shouted.</p><p>The man who had been ordered to go for ammunition stumbled against Pierre.</p>",
  "page-801": "<p>&ldquo;Eh, sir, this is no place for you,&rdquo; said he, and ran down the slope.</p><p>Pierre ran after him, avoiding the spot where the young officer was sitting.</p><p>One cannon ball, another, and a third flew over him, falling in front, beside, and behind him. Pierre ran down the slope. &ldquo;Where am I going?&rdquo; he suddenly asked himself when he was already near the green ammunition wagons. He halted irresolutely, not knowing whether to return or go on. Suddenly a terrible concussion threw him backwards to the ground. At the same instant he was dazzled by a great flash of flame, and immediately a deafening roar, crackling, and whistling made his ears tingle.</p>",
  "page-802": "<p>When he came to himself he was sitting on the ground leaning on his hands; the ammunition wagons he had been approaching no longer existed, only charred green boards and rags littered the scorched grass, and a horse, dangling fragments of its shaft behind it, galloped past, while another horse lay, like Pierre, on the ground, uttering prolonged and piercing cries.</p>",
  "page-803": "<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>",
  "page-804": "<p>Beside himself with terror Pierre jumped up and ran back to the battery, as to the only refuge from the horrors that surrounded him.</p><p>On entering the earthwork he noticed that there were men doing something there but that no shots were being fired from the battery. He had no time to realize who these men were. He saw the senior officer lying on the earth wall with his back turned as if he were examining something down below and that one of the soldiers he had noticed before was struggling forward shouting &ldquo;Brothers!&rdquo; and trying to free himself from some men who were holding him by the arm. He also saw something else that was strange.</p>",
  "page-805": "<p>But he had not time to realize that the colonel had been killed, that the soldier shouting &ldquo;Brothers!&rdquo; was a prisoner, and that another man had been bayoneted in the back before his eyes, for hardly had he run into the redoubt before a thin, sallow-faced, perspiring man in a blue uniform rushed on him sword in hand, shouting something. Instinctively guarding against the shock&mdash;for they had been running together at full speed before they saw one another&mdash;Pierre put out his hands and seized the man (a French officer) by the shoulder with one hand and by the throat with the other. The officer, dropping his sword, seized Pierre by his collar.</p><p>For some seconds they gazed with frightened eyes at one another&rsquo;s unfamiliar faces and both were perplexed at what they had done and what they were to do next.</p>",
  "page-806": "<p> &ldquo;Am I taken prisoner or have I taken him prisoner?&rdquo; each was thinking. But the French officer was evidently more inclined to think he had been taken prisoner because Pierre&rsquo;s strong hand, impelled by instinctive fear, squeezed his throat ever tighter and tighter. The Frenchman was about to say something, when just above their heads, terrible and low, a cannon ball whistled, and it seemed to Pierre that the French officer&rsquo;s head had been torn off, so swiftly had he ducked it.</p><p>Pierre too bent his head and let his hands fall. Without further thought as to who had taken whom prisoner, the Frenchman ran back to the battery and Pierre ran down the slope stumbling over the dead and wounded who, it seemed to him, caught at his feet.</p>",
  "page-807": "<p> But before he reached the foot of the knoll he was met by a dense crowd of Russian soldiers who, stumbling, tripping up, and shouting, ran merrily and wildly toward the battery. (This was the attack for which Ermólov claimed the credit, declaring that only his courage and good luck made such a feat possible: it was the attack in which he was said to have thrown some St. George&rsquo;s Crosses he had in his pocket into the battery for the first soldiers to take who got there.)</p><p>The French who had occupied the battery fled, and our troops shouting &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; pursued them so far beyond the battery that it was difficult to call them back.</p>",
  "page-808": "<p>The prisoners were brought down from the battery and among them was a wounded French general, whom the officers surrounded. Crowds of wounded&mdash;some known to Pierre and some unknown&mdash;Russians and French, with faces distorted by suffering, walked, crawled, and were carried on stretchers from the battery. Pierre again went up onto the knoll where he had spent over an hour, and of that family circle which had received him as a member he did not find a single one. There were many dead whom he did not know, but some he recognized. The young officer still sat in the same way, bent double, in a pool of blood at the edge of the earth wall. The red-faced man was still twitching, but they did not carry him away.</p>",
  "page-809": "<p>Pierre ran down the slope once more.</p><p>&ldquo;Now they will stop it, now they will be horrified at what they have done!&rdquo; he thought, aimlessly going toward a crowd of stretcher bearers moving from the battlefield.</p><p>But behind the veil of smoke the sun was still high, and in front and especially to the left, near Semënovsk, something seemed to be seething in the smoke, and the roar of cannon and musketry did not diminish, but even increased to desperation like a man who, straining himself, shrieks with all his remaining strength.</p>",
  "page-810": "<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>",
  "page-811": "<p>The chief action of the battle of Borodinó was fought within the seven thousand feet between Borodinó and Bagratión&rsquo;s flèches. Beyond that space there was, on the one side, a demonstration made by the Russians with Uvárov&rsquo;s cavalry at midday, and on the other side, beyond Utítsa, Poniatowski&rsquo;s collision with Túchkov; but these two were detached and feeble actions in comparison with what took place in the center of the battlefield. On the field between Borodinó and the flèches, beside the wood, the chief action of the day took place on an open space visible from both sides and was fought in the simplest and most artless way.</p><p>The battle began on both sides with a cannonade from several hundred guns.</p>",
  "page-812": "<p>Then when the whole field was covered with smoke, two divisions, Campan&rsquo;s and Dessaix&rsquo;s, advanced from the French right, while Murat&rsquo;s troops advanced on Borodinó from their left.</p><p>From the Shevárdino Redoubt where Napoleon was standing the flèches were two thirds of a mile away, and it was more than a mile as the crow flies to Borodinó, so that Napoleon could not see what was happening there, especially as the smoke mingling with the mist hid the whole locality. The soldiers of Dessaix&rsquo;s division advancing against the flèches could only be seen till they had entered the hollow that lay between them and the flèches. As soon as they had descended into that hollow, the smoke of the guns and musketry on the flèches grew so dense that it covered the whole approach on that side of it.</p>",
  "page-813": "<p> Through the smoke glimpses could be caught of something black&mdash;probably men&mdash;and at times the glint of bayonets. But whether they were moving or stationary, whether they were French or Russian, could not be discovered from the Shevárdino Redoubt.</p><p>The sun had risen brightly and its slanting rays struck straight into Napoleon&rsquo;s face as, shading his eyes with his hand, he looked at the flèches. The smoke spread out before them, and at times it looked as if the smoke were moving, at times as if the troops moved. Sometimes shouts were heard through the firing, but it was impossible to tell what was being done there.</p><p>Napoleon, standing on the knoll, looked through a field glass, and in its small circlet saw smoke and men, sometimes his own and sometimes Russians, but when he looked again with the naked eye, he could not tell where what he had seen was.</p>",
  "page-814": "<p>He descended the knoll and began walking up and down before it.</p><p>Occasionally he stopped, listened to the firing, and gazed intently at the battlefield.</p><p>But not only was it impossible to make out what was happening from where he was standing down below, or from the knoll above on which some of his generals had taken their stand, but even from the flèches themselves&mdash;in which by this time there were now Russian and now French soldiers, alternately or together, dead, wounded, alive, frightened, or maddened&mdash;even at those flèches themselves it was impossible to make out what was taking place. There for several hours amid incessant cannon and musketry fire, now Russians were seen alone, now Frenchmen alone, now infantry, and now cavalry: they appeared, fired, fell, collided, not knowing what to do with one another, screamed, and ran back again.</p>",
  "page-815": "<p>From the battlefield adjutants he had sent out, and orderlies from his marshals, kept galloping up to Napoleon with reports of the progress of the action, but all these reports were false, both because it was impossible in the heat of battle to say what was happening at any given moment and because many of the adjutants did not go to the actual place of conflict but reported what they had heard from others; and also because while an adjutant was riding more than a mile to Napoleon circumstances changed and the news he brought was already becoming false. Thus an adjutant galloped up from Murat with tidings that Borodinó had been occupied and the bridge over the Kolochá was in the hands of the French. The adjutant asked whether Napoleon wished the troops to cross it? Napoleon gave orders that the troops should form up on the farther side and wait.</p>",
  "page-816": "<p> But before that order was given&mdash;almost as soon in fact as the adjutant had left Borodinó&mdash;the bridge had been retaken by the Russians and burned, in the very skirmish at which Pierre had been present at the beginning of the battle.</p><p>An adjutant galloped up from the flèches with a pale and frightened face and reported to Napoleon that their attack had been repulsed, Campan wounded, and Davout killed; yet at the very time the adjutant had been told that the French had been repulsed, the flèches had in fact been recaptured by other French troops, and Davout was alive and only slightly bruised. On the basis of these necessarily untrustworthy reports Napoleon gave his orders, which had either been executed before he gave them or could not be and were not executed.</p>",
  "page-817": "<p>The marshals and generals, who were nearer to the field of battle but, like Napoleon, did not take part in the actual fighting and only occasionally went within musket range, made their own arrangements without asking Napoleon and issued orders where and in what direction to fire and where cavalry should gallop and infantry should run. But even their orders, like Napoleon&rsquo;s, were seldom carried out, and then but partially. For the most part things happened contrary to their orders. Soldiers ordered to advance ran back on meeting grapeshot; soldiers ordered to remain where they were, suddenly, seeing Russians unexpectedly before them, sometimes rushed back and sometimes forward, and the cavalry dashed without orders in pursuit of the flying Russians. In this way two cavalry regiments galloped through the Semënovsk hollow and as soon as they reached the top of the incline turned round and galloped full speed back again.</p>",
  "page-818": "<p> The infantry moved in the same way, sometimes running to quite other places than those they were ordered to go to. All orders as to where and when to move the guns, when to send infantry to shoot or horsemen to ride down the Russian infantry&mdash;all such orders were given by the officers on the spot nearest to the units concerned, without asking either Ney, Davout, or Murat, much less Napoleon. They did not fear getting into trouble for not fulfilling orders or for acting on their own initiative, for in battle what is at stake is what is dearest to man&mdash;his own life&mdash;and it sometimes seems that safety lies in running back, sometimes in running forward; and these men who were right in the heat of the battle acted according to the mood of the moment. In reality, however, all these movements forward and backward did not improve or alter the position of the troops.</p>",
  "page-819": "<p> All their rushing and galloping at one another did little harm, the harm of disablement and death was caused by the balls and bullets that flew over the fields on which these men were floundering about. As soon as they left the place where the balls and bullets were flying about, their superiors, located in the background, re-formed them and brought them under discipline and under the influence of that discipline led them back to the zone of fire, where under the influence of fear of death they lost their discipline and rushed about according to the chance promptings of the throng.</p>",
  "page-820": "<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>",
  "page-821": "<p>Napoleon&rsquo;s generals&mdash;Davout, Ney, and Murat, who were near that region of fire and sometimes even entered it&mdash;repeatedly led into it huge masses of well-ordered troops. But contrary to what had always happened in their former battles, instead of the news they expected of the enemy&rsquo;s flight, these orderly masses returned thence as disorganized and terrified mobs. The generals re-formed them, but their numbers constantly decreased. In the middle of the day Murat sent his adjutant to Napoleon to demand reinforcements.</p><p>Napoleon sat at the foot of the knoll, drinking punch, when Murat&rsquo;s adjutant galloped up with an assurance that the Russians would be routed if His Majesty would let him have another division.</p>",
  "page-822": "<p>&ldquo;Reinforcements?&rdquo; said Napoleon in a tone of stern surprise, looking at the adjutant&mdash;a handsome lad with long black curls arranged like Murat&rsquo;s own&mdash;as though he did not understand his words.</p><p>&ldquo;Reinforcements!&rdquo; thought Napoleon to himself. &ldquo;How can they need reinforcements when they already have half the army directed against a weak, unentrenched Russian wing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell the King of Naples,&rdquo; said he sternly, &ldquo;that it is not noon yet, and I don&rsquo;t yet see my chessboard clearly. Go!...&rdquo;</p><p>The handsome boy adjutant with the long hair sighed deeply without removing his hand from his hat and galloped back to where men were being slaughtered.</p>",
  "page-823": "<p>Napoleon rose and having summoned Caulaincourt and Berthier began talking to them about matters unconnected with the battle.</p><p>In the midst of this conversation, which was beginning to interest Napoleon, Berthier&rsquo;s eyes turned to look at a general with a suite, who was galloping toward the knoll on a lathering horse. It was Belliard. Having dismounted he went up to the Emperor with rapid strides and in a loud voice began boldly demonstrating the necessity of sending reinforcements. He swore on his honor that the Russians were lost if the Emperor would give another division.</p><p>Napoleon shrugged his shoulders and continued to pace up and down without replying. Belliard began talking loudly and eagerly to the generals of the suite around him.</p>",
  "page-824": "<p>&ldquo;You are very fiery, Belliard,&rdquo; said Napoleon, when he again came up to the general. &ldquo;In the heat of a battle it is easy to make a mistake. Go and have another look and then come back to me.&rdquo;</p><p>Before Belliard was out of sight, a messenger from another part of the battlefield galloped up.</p><p>&ldquo;Now then, what do you want?&rdquo; asked Napoleon in the tone of a man irritated at being continually disturbed.</p><p>&ldquo;Sire, the prince...&rdquo; began the adjutant.</p><p>&ldquo;Asks for reinforcements?&rdquo; said Napoleon with an angry gesture.</p>",
  "page-825": "<p>The adjutant bent his head affirmatively and began to report, but the Emperor turned from him, took a couple of steps, stopped, came back, and called Berthier.</p><p>&ldquo;We must give reserves,&rdquo; he said, moving his arms slightly apart. &ldquo;Who do you think should be sent there?&rdquo; he asked of Berthier (whom he subsequently termed &ldquo;that gosling I have made an eagle&rdquo;).</p><p>&ldquo;Send Claparède&rsquo;s division, sire,&rdquo; replied Berthier, who knew all the division&rsquo;s regiments, and battalions by heart.</p><p>Napoleon nodded assent.</p><p>The adjutant galloped to Claparède&rsquo;s division and a few minutes later the Young Guards stationed behind the knoll moved forward. Napoleon gazed silently in that direction.</p>",
  "page-826": "<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he suddenly said to Berthier. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t send Claparède. Send Friant&rsquo;s division.&rdquo;</p><p>Though there was no advantage in sending Friant&rsquo;s division instead of Claparède&rsquo;s, and even an obvious inconvenience and delay in stopping Claparède and sending Friant now, the order was carried out exactly. Napoleon did not notice that in regard to his army he was playing the part of a doctor who hinders by his medicines&mdash;a role he so justly understood and condemned.</p><p>Friant&rsquo;s division disappeared as the others had done into the smoke of the battlefield. From all sides adjutants continued to arrive at a gallop and as if by agreement all said the same thing. They all asked for reinforcements and all said that the Russians were holding their positions and maintaining a hellish fire under which the French army was melting away.</p>",
  "page-827": "<p>Napoleon sat on a campstool, wrapped in thought.</p><p>M. de Beausset, the man so fond of travel, having fasted since morning, came up to the Emperor and ventured respectfully to suggest lunch to His Majesty.</p><p>&ldquo;I hope I may now congratulate Your Majesty on a victory?&rdquo; said he.</p><p>Napoleon silently shook his head in negation. Assuming the negation to refer only to the victory and not to the lunch, M. de Beausset ventured with respectful jocularity to remark that there is no reason for not having lunch when one can get it.</p><p>&ldquo;Go away...&rdquo; exclaimed Napoleon suddenly and morosely, and turned aside.</p>",
  "page-828": "<p>A beatific smile of regret, repentance, and ecstasy beamed on M. de Beausset&rsquo;s face and he glided away to the other generals.</p><p>Napoleon was experiencing a feeling of depression like that of an ever-lucky gambler who, after recklessly flinging money about and always winning, suddenly just when he has calculated all the chances of the game, finds that the more he considers his play the more surely he loses.</p><p>His troops were the same, his generals the same, the same preparations had been made, the same dispositions, and the same proclamation courte et énergique, he himself was still the same: he knew that and knew that he was now even more experienced and skillful than before. Even the enemy was the same as at Austerlitz and Friedland&mdash;yet the terrible stroke of his arm had supernaturally become impotent.</p>",
  "page-829": "<p>All the old methods that had been unfailingly crowned with success: the concentration of batteries on one point, an attack by reserves to break the enemy&rsquo;s line, and a cavalry attack by &ldquo;the men of iron,&rdquo; all these methods had already been employed, yet not only was there no victory, but from all sides came the same news of generals killed and wounded, of reinforcements needed, of the impossibility of driving back the Russians, and of disorganization among his own troops.</p><p>Formerly, after he had given two or three orders and uttered a few phrases, marshals and adjutants had come galloping up with congratulations and happy faces, announcing the trophies taken, the corps of prisoners, bundles of enemy eagles and standards, cannon and stores, and Murat had only begged leave to loose the cavalry to gather in the baggage wagons.</p>",
  "page-830": "<p> So it had been at Lodi, Marengo, Arcola, Jena, Austerlitz, Wagram, and so on. But now something strange was happening to his troops.</p><p>Despite news of the capture of the flèches, Napoleon saw that this was not the same, not at all the same, as what had happened in his former battles. He saw that what he was feeling was felt by all the men about him experienced in the art of war. All their faces looked dejected, and they all shunned one another&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;only a de Beausset could fail to grasp the meaning of what was happening.</p><p>But Napoleon with his long experience of war well knew the meaning of a battle not gained by the attacking side in eight hours, after all efforts had been expended. He knew that it was a lost battle and that the least accident might now&mdash;with the fight balanced on such a strained center&mdash;destroy him and his army.</p>",
  "page-831": "<p>When he ran his mind over the whole of this strange Russian campaign in which not one battle had been won, and in which not a flag, or cannon, or army corps had been captured in two months, when he looked at the concealed depression on the faces around him and heard reports of the Russians still holding their ground&mdash;a terrible feeling like a nightmare took possession of him, and all the unlucky accidents that might destroy him occurred to his mind. The Russians might fall on his left wing, might break through his center, he himself might be killed by a stray cannon ball. All this was possible. In former battles he had only considered the possibilities of success, but now innumerable unlucky chances presented themselves, and he expected them all.</p>",
  "page-832": "<p> Yes, it was like a dream in which a man fancies that a ruffian is coming to attack him, and raises his arm to strike that ruffian a terrible blow which he knows should annihilate him, but then feels that his arm drops powerless and limp like a rag, and the horror of unavoidable destruction seizes him in his helplessness.</p><p>The news that the Russians were attacking the left flank of the French army aroused that horror in Napoleon. He sat silently on a campstool below the knoll, with head bowed and elbows on his knees. Berthier approached and suggested that they should ride along the line to ascertain the position of affairs.</p>",
  "page-833": "<p>&ldquo;What? What do you say?&rdquo; asked Napoleon. &ldquo;Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.&rdquo;</p><p>He mounted and rode toward Semënovsk.</p><p>Amid the powder smoke, slowly dispersing over the whole space through which Napoleon rode, horses and men were lying in pools of blood, singly or in heaps. Neither Napoleon nor any of his generals had ever before seen such horrors or so many slain in such a small area. The roar of guns, that had not ceased for ten hours, wearied the ear and gave a peculiar significance to the spectacle, as music does to tableaux vivants. Napoleon rode up the high ground at Semënovsk, and through the smoke saw ranks of men in uniforms of a color unfamiliar to him. They were Russians.</p>",
  "page-834": "<p>The Russians stood in serried ranks behind Semënovsk village and its knoll, and their guns boomed incessantly along their line and sent forth clouds of smoke. It was no longer a battle: it was a continuous slaughter which could be of no avail either to the French or the Russians. Napoleon stopped his horse and again fell into the reverie from which Berthier had aroused him. He could not stop what was going on before him and around him and was supposed to be directed by him and to depend on him, and from its lack of success this affair, for the first time, seemed to him unnecessary and horrible.</p><p>One of the generals rode up to Napoleon and ventured to offer to lead the Old Guard into action. Ney and Berthier, standing near Napoleon, exchanged looks and smiled contemptuously at this general&rsquo;s senseless offer.</p>",
  "page-835": "<p>Napoleon bowed his head and remained silent a long time.</p><p>&ldquo;At eight hundred leagues from France, I will not have my Guard destroyed!&rdquo; he said, and turning his horse rode back to Shevárdino.</p>",
  "page-836": "<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>",
  "page-837": "<p>On the rug-covered bench where Pierre had seen him in the morning sat Kutúzov, his gray head hanging, his heavy body relaxed. He gave no orders, but only assented to or dissented from what others suggested.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, do that,&rdquo; he replied to various proposals. &ldquo;Yes, yes: go, dear boy, and have a look,&rdquo; he would say to one or another of those about him; or, &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;d better wait!&rdquo; He listened to the reports that were brought him and gave directions when his subordinates demanded that of him; but when listening to the reports it seemed as if he were not interested in the import of the words spoken, but rather in something else&mdash;in the expression of face and tone of voice of those who were reporting.</p>",
  "page-838": "<p> By long years of military experience he knew, and with the wisdom of age understood, that it is impossible for one man to direct hundreds of thousands of others struggling with death, and he knew that the result of a battle is decided not by the orders of a commander in chief, nor the place where the troops are stationed, nor by the number of cannon or of slaughtered men, but by that intangible force called the spirit of the army, and he watched this force and guided it in as far as that was in his power.</p><p>Kutúzov&rsquo;s general expression was one of concentrated quiet attention, and his face wore a strained look as if he found it difficult to master the fatigue of his old and feeble body.</p>",
  "page-839": "<p>At eleven o&rsquo;clock they brought him news that the flèches captured by the French had been retaken, but that Prince Bagratión was wounded. Kutúzov groaned and swayed his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Ride over to Prince Peter Ivánovich and find out about it exactly,&rdquo; he said to one of his adjutants, and then turned to the Duke of Württemberg who was standing behind him.</p><p>&ldquo;Will Your Highness please take command of the first army?&rdquo;</p><p>Soon after the duke&rsquo;s departure&mdash;before he could possibly have reached Semënovsk&mdash;his adjutant came back from him and told Kutúzov that the duke asked for more troops.</p>",
  "page-840": "<p>Kutúzov made a grimace and sent an order to Dokhtúrov to take over the command of the first army, and a request to the duke&mdash;whom he said he could not spare at such an important moment&mdash;to return to him. When they brought him news that Murat had been taken prisoner, and the staff officers congratulated him, Kutúzov smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait a little, gentlemen,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The battle is won, and there is nothing extraordinary in the capture of Murat. Still, it is better to wait before we rejoice.&rdquo;</p><p>But he sent an adjutant to take the news round the army.</p>",
  "page-841": "<p>When Scherbínin came galloping from the left flank with news that the French had captured the flèches and the village of Semënovsk, Kutúzov, guessing by the sounds of the battle and by Scherbínin&rsquo;s looks that the news was bad, rose as if to stretch his legs and, taking Scherbínin&rsquo;s arm, led him aside.</p><p>&ldquo;Go, my dear fellow,&rdquo; he said to Ermólov, &ldquo;and see whether something can&rsquo;t be done.&rdquo;</p><p>Kutúzov was in Górki, near the center of the Russian position. The attack directed by Napoleon against our left flank had been several times repulsed. In the center the French had not got beyond Borodinó, and on their left flank Uvárov&rsquo;s cavalry had put the French to flight.</p>",
  "page-842": "<p>Toward three o&rsquo;clock the French attacks ceased. On the faces of all who came from the field of battle, and of those who stood around him, Kutúzov noticed an expression of extreme tension. He was satisfied with the day&rsquo;s success&mdash;a success exceeding his expectations, but the old man&rsquo;s strength was failing him. Several times his head dropped low as if it were falling and he dozed off. Dinner was brought him.</p><p>Adjutant General Wolzogen, the man who when riding past Prince Andrew had said, &ldquo;the war should be extended widely,&rdquo; and whom Bagratión so detested, rode up while Kutúzov was at dinner. Wolzogen had come from Barclay de Tolly to report on the progress of affairs on the left flank.</p>",
  "page-843": "<p> The sagacious Barclay de Tolly, seeing crowds of wounded men running back and the disordered rear of the army, weighed all the circumstances, concluded that the battle was lost, and sent his favorite officer to the commander in chief with that news.</p><p>Kutúzov was chewing a piece of roast chicken with difficulty and glanced at Wolzogen with eyes that brightened under their puckering lids.</p><p>Wolzogen, nonchalantly stretching his legs, approached Kutúzov with a half-contemptuous smile on his lips, scarcely touching the peak of his cap.</p><p>He treated his Serene Highness with a somewhat affected nonchalance intended to show that, as a highly trained military man, he left it to Russians to make an idol of this useless old man, but that he knew whom he was dealing with. &ldquo;Der alte Herr&rdquo; (as in their own set the Germans called Kutúzov) &ldquo;is making himself very comfortable,&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-844": "<p> thought Wolzogen, and looking severely at the dishes in front of Kutúzov he began to report to &ldquo;the old gentleman&rdquo; the position of affairs on the left flank as Barclay had ordered him to and as he himself had seen and understood it.</p><p>&ldquo;All the points of our position are in the enemy&rsquo;s hands and we cannot dislodge them for lack of troops, the men are running away and it is impossible to stop them,&rdquo; he reported.</p><p>Kutúzov ceased chewing and fixed an astonished gaze on Wolzogen, as if not understanding what was said to him. Wolzogen, noticing &ldquo;the old gentleman&rsquo;s&rdquo; agitation, said with a smile:</p>",
  "page-845": "<p>&ldquo;I have not considered it right to conceal from your Serene Highness what I have seen. The troops are in complete disorder....&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have seen? You have seen?...&rdquo; Kutúzov shouted. Frowning and rising quickly, he went up to Wolzogen.</p><p>&ldquo;How... how dare you!...&rdquo; he shouted, choking and making a threatening gesture with his trembling arms: &ldquo;How dare you, sir, say that to me? You know nothing about it. Tell General Barclay from me that his information is incorrect and that the real course of the battle is better known to me, the commander in chief, than to him.&rdquo;</p><p>Wolzogen was about to make a rejoinder, but Kutúzov interrupted him.</p>",
  "page-846": "<p>&ldquo;The enemy has been repulsed on the left and defeated on the right flank. If you have seen amiss, sir, do not allow yourself to say what you don&rsquo;t know! Be so good as to ride to General Barclay and inform him of my firm intention to attack the enemy tomorrow,&rdquo; said Kutúzov sternly.</p><p>All were silent, and the only sound audible was the heavy breathing of the panting old general.</p><p>&ldquo;They are repulsed everywhere, for which I thank God and our brave army! The enemy is beaten, and tomorrow we shall drive him from the sacred soil of Russia,&rdquo; said Kutúzov crossing himself, and he suddenly sobbed as his eyes filled with tears.</p>",
  "page-847": "<p>Wolzogen, shrugging his shoulders and curling his lips, stepped silently aside, marveling at &ldquo;the old gentleman&rsquo;s&rdquo; conceited stupidity.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, here he is, my hero!&rdquo; said Kutúzov to a portly, handsome, dark-haired general who was just ascending the knoll.</p><p>This was Raévski, who had spent the whole day at the most important part of the field of Borodinó.</p><p>Raévski reported that the troops were firmly holding their ground and that the French no longer ventured to attack.</p><p>After hearing him, Kutúzov said in French:</p><p>&ldquo;Then you do not think, like some others, that we must retreat?&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-848": "<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, your Highness, in indecisive actions it is always the most stubborn who remain victors,&rdquo; replied Raévski, &ldquo;and in my opinion...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kaysárov!&rdquo; Kutúzov called to his adjutant. &ldquo;Sit down and write out the order of the day for tomorrow. And you,&rdquo; he continued, addressing another, &ldquo;ride along the line and announce that tomorrow we attack.&rdquo;</p><p>While Kutúzov was talking to Raévski and dictating the order of the day, Wolzogen returned from Barclay and said that General Barclay wished to have written confirmation of the order the field marshal had given.</p><p>Kutúzov, without looking at Wolzogen, gave directions for the order to be written out which the former commander in chief, to avoid personal responsibility, very judiciously wished to receive.</p>",
  "page-849": "<p>And by means of that mysterious indefinable bond which maintains throughout an army one and the same temper, known as &ldquo;the spirit of the army,&rdquo; and which constitutes the sinew of war, Kutúzov&rsquo;s words, his order for a battle next day, immediately became known from one end of the army to the other.</p><p>It was far from being the same words or the same order that reached the farthest links of that chain. The tales passing from mouth to mouth at different ends of the army did not even resemble what Kutúzov had said, but the sense of his words spread everywhere because what he said was not the outcome of cunning calculations, but of a feeling that lay in the commander in chief&rsquo;s soul as in that of every Russian.</p>",
  "page-850": "<p>And on learning that tomorrow they were to attack the enemy, and hearing from the highest quarters a confirmation of what they wanted to believe, the exhausted, wavering men felt comforted and inspirited.</p>",
  "page-851": "<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>",
  "page-852": "<p>Prince Andrew&rsquo;s regiment was among the reserves which till after one o&rsquo;clock were stationed inactive behind Semënovsk, under heavy artillery fire. Toward two o&rsquo;clock the regiment, having already lost more than two hundred men, was moved forward into a trampled oatfield in the gap between Semënovsk and the Knoll Battery, where thousands of men perished that day and on which an intense, concentrated fire from several hundred enemy guns was directed between one and two o&rsquo;clock.</p><p>Without moving from that spot or firing a single shot the regiment here lost another third of its men. From in front and especially from the right, in the unlifting smoke the guns boomed, and out of the mysterious domain of smoke that overlay the whole space in front, quick hissing cannon balls and slow whistling shells flew unceasingly.</p>",
  "page-853": "<p> At times, as if to allow them a respite, a quarter of an hour passed during which the cannon balls and shells all flew overhead, but sometimes several men were torn from the regiment in a minute and the slain were continually being dragged away and the wounded carried off.</p><p>With each fresh blow less and less chance of life remained for those not yet killed. The regiment stood in columns of battalion, three hundred paces apart, but nevertheless the men were always in one and the same mood. All alike were taciturn and morose. Talk was rarely heard in the ranks, and it ceased altogether every time the thud of a successful shot and the cry of &ldquo;stretchers!&rdquo; was heard. Most of the time, by their officers&rsquo; order, the men sat on the ground.</p>",
  "page-854": "<p> One, having taken off his shako, carefully loosened the gathers of its lining and drew them tight again; another, rubbing some dry clay between his palms, polished his bayonet; another fingered the strap and pulled the buckle of his bandolier, while another smoothed and refolded his leg bands and put his boots on again. Some built little houses of the tufts in the plowed ground, or plaited baskets from the straw in the cornfield. All seemed fully absorbed in these pursuits. When men were killed or wounded, when rows of stretchers went past, when some troops retreated, and when great masses of the enemy came into view through the smoke, no one paid any attention to these things. But when our artillery or cavalry advanced or some of our infantry were seen to move forward, words of approval were heard on all sides.</p>",
  "page-855": "<p> But the liveliest attention was attracted by occurrences quite apart from, and unconnected with, the battle. It was as if the minds of these morally exhausted men found relief in everyday, commonplace occurrences. A battery of artillery was passing in front of the regiment. The horse of an ammunition cart put its leg over a trace. &ldquo;Hey, look at the trace horse!... Get her leg out! She&rsquo;ll fall.... Ah, they don&rsquo;t see it!&rdquo; came identical shouts from the ranks all along the regiment. Another time, general attention was attracted by a small brown dog, coming heaven knows whence, which trotted in a preoccupied manner in front of the ranks with tail stiffly erect till suddenly a shell fell close by, when it yelped, tucked its tail between its legs, and darted aside. Yells and shrieks of laughter rose from the whole regiment.</p>",
  "page-856": "<p> But such distractions lasted only a moment, and for eight hours the men had been inactive, without food, in constant fear of death, and their pale and gloomy faces grew ever paler and gloomier.</p><p>Prince Andrew, pale and gloomy like everyone in the regiment, paced up and down from the border of one patch to another, at the edge of the meadow beside an oatfield, with head bowed and arms behind his back. There was nothing for him to do and no orders to be given. Everything went on of itself. The killed were dragged from the front, the wounded carried away, and the ranks closed up. If any soldiers ran to the rear they returned immediately and hastily. At first Prince Andrew, considering it his duty to rouse the courage of the men and to set them an example, walked about among the ranks, but he soon became convinced that this was unnecessary and that there was nothing he could teach them.</p>",
  "page-857": "<p> All the powers of his soul, as of every soldier there, were unconsciously bent on avoiding the contemplation of the horrors of their situation. He walked along the meadow, dragging his feet, rustling the grass, and gazing at the dust that covered his boots; now he took big strides trying to keep to the footprints left on the meadow by the mowers, then he counted his steps, calculating how often he must walk from one strip to another to walk a mile, then he stripped the flowers from the wormwood that grew along a boundary rut, rubbed them in his palms, and smelled their pungent, sweetly bitter scent. Nothing remained of the previous day&rsquo;s thoughts. He thought of nothing. He listened with weary ears to the ever-recurring sounds, distinguishing the whistle of flying projectiles from the booming of the reports, glanced at the tiresomely familiar faces of the men of the first battalion, and waited.</p>",
  "page-858": "<p> &ldquo;Here it comes... this one is coming our way again!&rdquo; he thought, listening to an approaching whistle in the hidden region of smoke. &ldquo;One, another! Again! It has hit....&rdquo; He stopped and looked at the ranks. &ldquo;No, it has gone over. But this one has hit!&rdquo; And again he started trying to reach the boundary strip in sixteen paces. A whizz and a thud! Five paces from him, a cannon ball tore up the dry earth and disappeared. A chill ran down his back. Again he glanced at the ranks. Probably many had been hit&mdash;a large crowd had gathered near the second battalion.</p><p>&ldquo;Adjutant!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Order them not to crowd together.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-859": "<p>The adjutant, having obeyed this instruction, approached Prince Andrew. From the other side a battalion commander rode up.</p><p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; came a frightened cry from a soldier and, like a bird whirring in rapid flight and alighting on the ground, a shell dropped with little noise within two steps of Prince Andrew and close to the battalion commander&rsquo;s horse. The horse first, regardless of whether it was right or wrong to show fear, snorted, reared almost throwing the major, and galloped aside. The horse&rsquo;s terror infected the men.</p><p>&ldquo;Lie down!&rdquo; cried the adjutant, throwing himself flat on the ground.</p>",
  "page-860": "<p>Prince Andrew hesitated. The smoking shell spun like a top between him and the prostrate adjutant, near a wormwood plant between the field and the meadow.</p><p>&ldquo;Can this be death?&rdquo; thought Prince Andrew, looking with a quite new, envious glance at the grass, the wormwood, and the streamlet of smoke that curled up from the rotating black ball. &ldquo;I cannot, I do not wish to die. I love life&mdash;I love this grass, this earth, this air....&rdquo; He thought this, and at the same time remembered that people were looking at him.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s shameful, sir!&rdquo; he said to the adjutant. &ldquo;What...&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-861": "<p>He did not finish speaking. At one and the same moment came the sound of an explosion, a whistle of splinters as from a breaking window frame, a suffocating smell of powder, and Prince Andrew started to one side, raising his arm, and fell on his chest. Several officers ran up to him. From the right side of his abdomen, blood was welling out making a large stain on the grass.</p><p>The militiamen with stretchers who were called up stood behind the officers. Prince Andrew lay on his chest with his face in the grass, breathing heavily and noisily.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you waiting for? Come along!&rdquo;</p><p>The peasants went up and took him by his shoulders and legs, but he moaned piteously and, exchanging looks, they set him down again.</p>",
  "page-862": "<p>&ldquo;Pick him up, lift him, it&rsquo;s all the same!&rdquo; cried someone.</p><p>They again took him by the shoulders and laid him on the stretcher.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, God! My God! What is it? The stomach? That means death! My God!&rdquo;&mdash;voices among the officers were heard saying.</p><p>&ldquo;It flew a hair&rsquo;s breadth past my ear,&rdquo; said the adjutant.</p><p>The peasants, adjusting the stretcher to their shoulders, started hurriedly along the path they had trodden down, to the dressing station.</p><p>&ldquo;Keep in step! Ah... those peasants!&rdquo; shouted an officer, seizing by their shoulders and checking the peasants, who were walking unevenly and jolting the stretcher.</p>",
  "page-863": "<p>&ldquo;Get into step, Fëdor... I say, Fëdor!&rdquo; said the foremost peasant.</p><p>&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; said the one behind joyfully, when he had got into step.</p><p>&ldquo;Your excellency! Eh, Prince!&rdquo; said the trembling voice of Timókhin, who had run up and was looking down on the stretcher.</p><p>Prince Andrew opened his eyes and looked up at the speaker from the stretcher into which his head had sunk deep and again his eyelids drooped.</p><p>The militiamen carried Prince Andrew to the dressing station by the wood, where wagons were stationed. The dressing station consisted of three tents with flaps turned back, pitched at the edge of a birch wood. In the wood, wagons and horses were standing. The horses were eating oats from their movable troughs and sparrows flew down and pecked the grains that fell.</p>",
  "page-864": "<p> Some crows, scenting blood, flew among the birch trees cawing impatiently. Around the tents, over more than five acres, bloodstained men in various garbs stood, sat, or lay. Around the wounded stood crowds of soldier stretcher-bearers with dismal and attentive faces, whom the officers keeping order tried in vain to drive from the spot. Disregarding the officers&rsquo; orders, the soldiers stood leaning against their stretchers and gazing intently, as if trying to comprehend the difficult problem of what was taking place before them. From the tents came now loud angry cries and now plaintive groans. Occasionally dressers ran out to fetch water, or to point out those who were to be brought in next. The wounded men awaiting their turn outside the tents groaned, sighed, wept, screamed, swore, or asked for vodka. Some were delirious.</p>",
  "page-865": "<p> Prince Andrew&rsquo;s bearers, stepping over the wounded who had not yet been bandaged, took him, as a regimental commander, close up to one of the tents and there stopped, awaiting instructions. Prince Andrew opened his eyes and for a long time could not make out what was going on around him. He remembered the meadow, the wormwood, the field, the whirling black ball, and his sudden rush of passionate love of life. Two steps from him, leaning against a branch and talking loudly and attracting general attention, stood a tall, handsome, black-haired noncommissioned officer with a bandaged head. He had been wounded in the head and leg by bullets. Around him, eagerly listening to his talk, a crowd of wounded and stretcher-bearers was gathered.</p><p>&ldquo;We kicked him out from there so that he chucked everything, we grabbed the King himself!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-866": "<p> cried he, looking around him with eyes that glittered with fever. &ldquo;If only reserves had come up just then, lads, there wouldn&rsquo;t have been nothing left of him! I tell you surely....&rdquo;</p><p>Like all the others near the speaker, Prince Andrew looked at him with shining eyes and experienced a sense of comfort. &ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t it all the same now?&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;And what will be there, and what has there been here? Why was I so reluctant to part with life? There was something in this life I did not and do not understand.&rdquo;</p>",

  "page-868": "<p>One of the doctors came out of the tent in a bloodstained apron, holding a cigar between the thumb and little finger of one of his small bloodstained hands, so as not to smear it. He raised his head and looked about him, but above the level of the wounded men. He evidently wanted a little respite. After turning his head from right to left for some time, he sighed and looked down.</p><p>&ldquo;All right, immediately,&rdquo; he replied to a dresser who pointed Prince Andrew out to him, and he told them to carry him into the tent.</p><p>Murmurs arose among the wounded who were waiting.</p><p>&ldquo;It seems that even in the next world only the gentry are to have a chance!&rdquo; remarked one.</p>",
  "page-869": "<p>Prince Andrew was carried in and laid on a table that had only just been cleared and which a dresser was washing down. Prince Andrew could not make out distinctly what was in that tent. The pitiful groans from all sides and the torturing pain in his thigh, stomach, and back distracted him. All he saw about him merged into a general impression of naked, bleeding human bodies that seemed to fill the whole of the low tent, as a few weeks previously, on that hot August day, such bodies had filled the dirty pond beside the Smolénsk road. Yes, it was the same flesh, the same chair à canon, the sight of which had even then filled him with horror, as by a presentiment.</p>",
  "page-870": "<p>There were three operating tables in the tent. Two were occupied, and on the third they placed Prince Andrew. For a little while he was left alone and involuntarily witnessed what was taking place on the other two tables. On the nearest one sat a Tartar, probably a Cossack, judging by the uniform thrown down beside him. Four soldiers were holding him, and a spectacled doctor was cutting into his muscular brown back.</p><p>&ldquo;Ooh, ooh, ooh!&rdquo; grunted the Tartar, and suddenly lifting up his swarthy snub-nosed face with its high cheekbones, and baring his white teeth, he began to wriggle and twitch his body and utter piercing, ringing, and prolonged yells. On the other table, round which many people were crowding, a tall well-fed man lay on his back with his head thrown back. His curly hair, its color, and the shape of his head seemed strangely familiar to Prince Andrew.</p>",
  "page-871": "<p> Several dressers were pressing on his chest to hold him down. One large, white, plump leg twitched rapidly all the time with a feverish tremor. The man was sobbing and choking convulsively. Two doctors&mdash;one of whom was pale and trembling&mdash;were silently doing something to this man&rsquo;s other, gory leg. When he had finished with the Tartar, whom they covered with an overcoat, the spectacled doctor came up to Prince Andrew, wiping his hands.</p><p>He glanced at Prince Andrew&rsquo;s face and quickly turned away.</p><p>&ldquo;Undress him! What are you waiting for?&rdquo; he cried angrily to the dressers.</p><p>His very first, remotest recollections of childhood came back to Prince Andrew&rsquo;s mind when the dresser with sleeves rolled up began hastily to undo the buttons of his clothes and undressed him. The doctor bent down over the wound, felt it, and sighed deeply.</p>",
  "page-872": "<p> Then he made a sign to someone, and the torturing pain in his abdomen caused Prince Andrew to lose consciousness. When he came to himself the splintered portions of his thighbone had been extracted, the torn flesh cut away, and the wound bandaged. Water was being sprinkled on his face. As soon as Prince Andrew opened his eyes, the doctor bent over, kissed him silently on the lips, and hurried away.</p><p>After the sufferings he had been enduring, Prince Andrew enjoyed a blissful feeling such as he had not experienced for a long time. All the best and happiest moments of his life&mdash;especially his earliest childhood, when he used to be undressed and put to bed, and when leaning over him his nurse sang him to sleep and he, burying his head in the pillow, felt happy in the mere consciousness of life&mdash;returned to his memory, not merely as something past but as something present.</p>",
  "page-873": "<p>The doctors were busily engaged with the wounded man the shape of whose head seemed familiar to Prince Andrew: they were lifting him up and trying to quiet him.</p><p>&ldquo;Show it to me.... Oh, ooh... Oh! Oh, ooh!&rdquo; his frightened moans could be heard, subdued by suffering and broken by sobs.</p><p>Hearing those moans Prince Andrew wanted to weep. Whether because he was dying without glory, or because he was sorry to part with life, or because of those memories of a childhood that could not return, or because he was suffering and others were suffering and that man near him was groaning so piteously&mdash;he felt like weeping childlike, kindly, and almost happy tears.</p>",
  "page-874": "<p>The wounded man was shown his amputated leg stained with clotted blood and with the boot still on.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh, ooh!&rdquo; he sobbed, like a woman.</p><p>The doctor who had been standing beside him, preventing Prince Andrew from seeing his face, moved away.</p><p>&ldquo;My God! What is this? Why is he here?&rdquo; said Prince Andrew to himself.</p><p>In the miserable, sobbing, enfeebled man whose leg had just been amputated, he recognized Anatole Kurágin. Men were supporting him in their arms and offering him a glass of water, but his trembling, swollen lips could not grasp its rim. Anatole was sobbing painfully. &ldquo;Yes, it is he! Yes, that man is somehow closely and painfully connected with me,&rdquo; thought Prince Andrew, not yet clearly grasping what he saw before him. &ldquo;What is the connection of that man with my childhood and life?&rdquo; he asked himself without finding an answer.</p>",
  "page-875": "<p> And suddenly a new unexpected memory from that realm of pure and loving childhood presented itself to him. He remembered Natásha as he had seen her for the first time at the ball in 1810, with her slender neck and arms and with a frightened happy face ready for rapture, and love and tenderness for her, stronger and more vivid than ever, awoke in his soul. He now remembered the connection that existed between himself and this man who was dimly gazing at him through tears that filled his swollen eyes. He remembered everything, and ecstatic pity and love for that man overflowed his happy heart.</p><p>Prince Andrew could no longer restrain himself and wept tender loving tears for his fellow men, for himself, and for his own and their errors.</p>",
  "page-876": "<p>&ldquo;Compassion, love of our brothers, for those who love us and for those who hate us, love of our enemies; yes, that love which God preached on earth and which Princess Mary taught me and I did not understand&mdash;that is what made me sorry to part with life, that is what remained for me had I lived. But now it is too late. I know it!&rdquo;</p>",

  "page-878": "<p>The terrible spectacle of the battlefield covered with dead and wounded, together with the heaviness of his head and the news that some twenty generals he knew personally had been killed or wounded, and the consciousness of the impotence of his once mighty arm, produced an unexpected impression on Napoleon who usually liked to look at the killed and wounded, thereby, he considered, testing his strength of mind. This day the horrible appearance of the battlefield overcame that strength of mind which he thought constituted his merit and his greatness. He rode hurriedly from the battlefield and returned to the Shevárdino knoll, where he sat on his campstool, his sallow face swollen and heavy, his eyes dim, his nose red, and his voice hoarse, involuntarily listening, with downcast eyes, to the sounds of firing.</p>",
  "page-879": "<p> With painful dejection he awaited the end of this action, in which he regarded himself as a participant and which he was unable to arrest. A personal, human feeling for a brief moment got the better of the artificial phantasm of life he had served so long. He felt in his own person the sufferings and death he had witnessed on the battlefield. The heaviness of his head and chest reminded him of the possibility of suffering and death for himself. At that moment he did not desire Moscow, or victory, or glory (what need had he for any more glory?). The one thing he wished for was rest, tranquillity, and freedom. But when he had been on the Semënovsk heights the artillery commander had proposed to him to bring several batteries of artillery up to those heights to strengthen the fire on the Russian troops crowded in front of Knyazkóvo.</p>",
  "page-880": "<p> Napoleon had assented and had given orders that news should be brought to him of the effect those batteries produced.</p><p>An adjutant came now to inform him that the fire of two hundred guns had been concentrated on the Russians, as he had ordered, but that they still held their ground.</p><p>&ldquo;Our fire is mowing them down by rows, but still they hold on,&rdquo; said the adjutant.</p><p>&ldquo;They want more!...&rdquo; said Napoleon in a hoarse voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Sire?&rdquo; asked the adjutant who had not heard the remark.</p>",
  "page-881": "<p>&ldquo;They want more!&rdquo; croaked Napoleon frowning. &ldquo;Let them have it!&rdquo;</p><p>Even before he gave that order the thing he did not desire, and for which he gave the order only because he thought it was expected of him, was being done. And he fell back into that artificial realm of imaginary greatness, and again&mdash;as a horse walking a treadmill thinks it is doing something for itself&mdash;he submissively fulfilled the cruel, sad, gloomy, and inhuman role predestined for him.</p><p>And not for that day and hour alone were the mind and conscience darkened of this man on whom the responsibility for what was happening lay more than on all the others who took part in it. Never to the end of his life could he understand goodness, beauty, or truth, or the significance of his actions which were too contrary to goodness and truth, too remote from everything human, for him ever to be able to grasp their meaning.</p>",
  "page-882": "<p> He could not disavow his actions, belauded as they were by half the world, and so he had to repudiate truth, goodness, and all humanity.</p><p>Not only on that day, as he rode over the battlefield strewn with men killed and maimed (by his will as he believed), did he reckon as he looked at them how many Russians there were for each Frenchman and, deceiving himself, find reason for rejoicing in the calculation that there were five Russians for every Frenchman. Not on that day alone did he write in a letter to Paris that &ldquo;the battle field was superb,&rdquo; because fifty thousand corpses lay there, but even on the island of St. Helena in the peaceful solitude where he said he intended to devote his leisure to an account of the great deeds he had done, he wrote:</p>",
  "page-883": "<p>The Russian war should have been the most popular war of modern times: it was a war of good sense, for real interests, for the tranquillity and security of all; it was purely pacific and conservative.</p><p>It was a war for a great cause, the end of uncertainties and the beginning of security. A new horizon and new labors were opening out, full of well-being and prosperity for all. The European system was already founded; all that remained was to organize it.</p><p>Satisfied on these great points and with tranquility everywhere, I too should have had my Congress and my Holy Alliance. Those ideas were stolen from me. In that reunion of great sovereigns we should have discussed our interests like one family, and have rendered account to the peoples as clerk to master.</p>",
  "page-884": "<p>Europe would in this way soon have been, in fact, but one people, and anyone who traveled anywhere would have found himself always in the common fatherland. I should have demanded the freedom of all navigable rivers for everybody, that the seas should be common to all, and that the great standing armies should be reduced henceforth to mere guards for the sovereigns.</p><p>On returning to France, to the bosom of the great, strong, magnificent, peaceful, and glorious fatherland, I should have proclaimed her frontiers immutable; all future wars purely defensive, all aggrandizement antinational. I should have associated my son in the Empire; my dictatorship would have been finished, and his constitutional reign would have begun.</p>",
  "page-885": "<p>Paris would have been the capital of the world, and the French the envy of the nations!</p><p>My leisure then, and my old age, would have been devoted, in company with the Empress and during the royal apprenticeship of my son, to leisurely visiting, with our own horses and like a true country couple, every corner of the Empire, receiving complaints, redressing wrongs, and scattering public buildings and benefactions on all sides and everywhere.</p><p>Napoleon, predestined by Providence for the gloomy role of executioner of the peoples, assured himself that the aim of his actions had been the peoples&rsquo; welfare and that he could control the fate of millions and by the employment of power confer benefactions.</p>",
  "page-886": "<p>&ldquo;Of four hundred thousand who crossed the Vistula,&rdquo; he wrote further of the Russian war, &ldquo;half were Austrians, Prussians, Saxons, Poles, Bavarians, Württembergers, Mecklenburgers, Spaniards, Italians, and Neapolitans. The Imperial army, strictly speaking, was one third composed of Dutch, Belgians, men from the borders of the Rhine, Piedmontese, Swiss, Genevese, Tuscans, Romans, inhabitants of the Thirty-second Military Division, of Bremen, of Hamburg, and so on: it included scarcely a hundred and forty thousand who spoke French. The Russian expedition actually cost France less than fifty thousand men; the Russian army in its retreat from Vílna to Moscow lost in the various battles four times more men than the French army; the burning of Moscow cost the lives of a hundred thousand Russians who died of cold and want in the woods;</p>",
  "page-887": "<p> finally, in its march from Moscow to the Oder the Russian army also suffered from the severity of the season; so that by the time it reached Vílna it numbered only fifty thousand, and at Kálisch less than eighteen thousand.&rdquo;</p><p>He imagined that the war with Russia came about by his will, and the horrors that occurred did not stagger his soul. He boldly took the whole responsibility for what happened, and his darkened mind found justification in the belief that among the hundreds of thousands who perished there were fewer Frenchmen than Hessians and Bavarians.</p>",

  "page-889": "<p>Several tens of thousands of the slain lay in diverse postures and various uniforms on the fields and meadows belonging to the Davýdov family and to the crown serfs&mdash;those fields and meadows where for hundreds of years the peasants of Borodinó, Górki, Shevárdino, and Semënovsk had reaped their harvests and pastured their cattle. At the dressing stations the grass and earth were soaked with blood for a space of some three acres around. Crowds of men of various arms, wounded and unwounded, with frightened faces, dragged themselves back to Mozháysk from the one army and back to Valúevo from the other. Other crowds, exhausted and hungry, went forward led by their officers. Others held their ground and continued to fire.</p>",
  "page-890": "<p>Over the whole field, previously so gaily beautiful with the glitter of bayonets and cloudlets of smoke in the morning sun, there now spread a mist of damp and smoke and a strange acid smell of saltpeter and blood. Clouds gathered and drops of rain began to fall on the dead and wounded, on the frightened, exhausted, and hesitating men, as if to say: &ldquo;Enough, men! Enough! Cease... bethink yourselves! What are you doing?&rdquo;</p><p>To the men of both sides alike, worn out by want of food and rest, it began equally to appear doubtful whether they should continue to slaughter one another; all the faces expressed hesitation, and the question arose in every soul: &ldquo;For what, for whom, must I kill and be killed?... You may go and kill whom you please, but I don&rsquo;t want to do so any more!&rdquo; By evening this thought had ripened in every soul.</p>",
  "page-891": "<p> At any moment these men might have been seized with horror at what they were doing and might have thrown up everything and run away anywhere.</p><p>But though toward the end of the battle the men felt all the horror of what they were doing, though they would have been glad to leave off, some incomprehensible, mysterious power continued to control them, and they still brought up the charges, loaded, aimed, and applied the match, though only one artilleryman survived out of every three, and though they stumbled and panted with fatigue, perspiring and stained with blood and powder. The cannon balls flew just as swiftly and cruelly from both sides, crushing human bodies, and that terrible work which was not done by the will of a man but at the will of Him who governs men and worlds continued.</p>",
  "page-892": "<p>Anyone looking at the disorganized rear of the Russian army would have said that, if only the French made one more slight effort, it would disappear; and anyone looking at the rear of the French army would have said that the Russians need only make one more slight effort and the French would be destroyed. But neither the French nor the Russians made that effort, and the flame of battle burned slowly out.</p><p>The Russians did not make that effort because they were not attacking the French. At the beginning of the battle they stood blocking the way to Moscow and they still did so at the end of the battle as at the beginning.</p>",
  "page-893": "<p> But even had the aim of the Russians been to drive the French from their positions, they could not have made this last effort, for all the Russian troops had been broken up, there was no part of the Russian army that had not suffered in the battle, and though still holding their positions they had lost ONE HALF of their army.</p><p>The French, with the memory of all their former victories during fifteen years, with the assurance of Napoleon&rsquo;s invincibility, with the consciousness that they had captured part of the battlefield and had lost only a quarter of their men and still had their Guards intact, twenty thousand strong, might easily have made that effort. The French who had attacked the Russian army in order to drive it from its position ought to have made that effort, for as long as the Russians continued to block the road to Moscow as before, the aim of the French had not been attained and all their efforts and losses were in vain.</p>",
  "page-894": "<p> But the French did not make that effort. Some historians say that Napoleon need only have used his Old Guards, who were intact, and the battle would have been won. To speak of what would have happened had Napoleon sent his Guards is like talking of what would happen if autumn became spring. It could not be. Napoleon did not give his Guards, not because he did not want to, but because it could not be done. All the generals, officers, and soldiers of the French army knew it could not be done, because the flagging spirit of the troops would not permit it.</p><p>It was not Napoleon alone who had experienced that nightmare feeling of the mighty arm being stricken powerless, but all the generals and soldiers of his army whether they had taken part in the battle or not, after all their experience of previous battles&mdash;</p>",
  "page-895": "<p>when after one tenth of such efforts the enemy had fled&mdash;experienced a similar feeling of terror before an enemy who, after losing HALF his men, stood as threateningly at the end as at the beginning of the battle. The moral force of the attacking French army was exhausted. Not that sort of victory which is defined by the capture of pieces of material fastened to sticks, called standards, and of the ground on which the troops had stood and were standing, but a moral victory that convinces the enemy of the moral superiority of his opponent and of his own impotence was gained by the Russians at Borodinó. The French invaders, like an infuriated animal that has in its onslaught received a mortal wound, felt that they were perishing, but could not stop, any more than the Russian army, weaker by one half, could help swerving.</p>",
  "page-896": "<p> By impetus gained, the French army was still able to roll forward to Moscow, but there, without further effort on the part of the Russians, it had to perish, bleeding from the mortal wound it had received at Borodinó. The direct consequence of the battle of Borodinó was Napoleon&rsquo;s senseless flight from Moscow, his retreat along the old Smolénsk road, the destruction of the invading army of five hundred thousand men, and the downfall of Napoleonic France, on which at Borodinó for the first time the hand of an opponent of stronger spirit had been laid.</p>",

Laws of motion of any kind become comprehensible to man only when he examines arbitrarily selected elements of that motion; but at the same time, a large proportion of human error comes from the arbitrary division of continuous motion into discontinuous elements. There is a well-known, so-called sophism of the ancients consisting in this, that Achilles could never catch up with a tortoise he was following, in spite of the fact that he traveled ten times as fast as the tortoise. By the time Achilles has covered the distance that separated him from the tortoise, the tortoise has covered one tenth of that distance ahead of him: when Achilles has covered that tenth, the tortoise has covered another one hundredth, and so on forever. This problem seemed to the ancients insoluble.</p>",
  "page-900": "<p> The absurd answer (that Achilles could never overtake the tortoise) resulted from this: that motion was arbitrarily divided into discontinuous elements, whereas the motion both of Achilles and of the tortoise was continuous.</p><p>By adopting smaller and smaller elements of motion we only approach a solution of the problem, but never reach it. Only when we have admitted the conception of the infinitely small, and the resulting geometrical progression with a common ratio of one tenth, and have found the sum of this progression to infinity, do we reach a solution of the problem.</p><p>A modern branch of mathematics having achieved the art of dealing with the infinitely small can now yield solutions in other more complex problems of motion which used to appear insoluble.</p>",
  "page-901": "<p>This modern branch of mathematics, unknown to the ancients, when dealing with problems of motion admits the conception of the infinitely small, and so conforms to the chief condition of motion (absolute continuity) and thereby corrects the inevitable error which the human mind cannot avoid when it deals with separate elements of motion instead of examining continuous motion.</p><p>In seeking the laws of historical movement just the same thing happens. The movement of humanity, arising as it does from innumerable arbitrary human wills, is continuous.</p><p>To understand the laws of this continuous movement is the aim of history. But to arrive at these laws, resulting from the sum of all those human wills, man&rsquo;s mind postulates arbitrary and disconnected units. The first method of history is to take an arbitrarily selected series of continuous events and examine it apart from others, though there is and can be no beginning to any event, for one event always flows uninterruptedly from another.</p>",
  "page-902": "<p>The second method is to consider the actions of some one man&mdash;a king or a commander&mdash;as equivalent to the sum of many individual wills; whereas the sum of individual wills is never expressed by the activity of a single historic personage.</p><p>Historical science in its endeavor to draw nearer to truth continually takes smaller and smaller units for examination. But however small the units it takes, we feel that to take any unit disconnected from others, or to assume a beginning of any phenomenon, or to say that the will of many men is expressed by the actions of any one historic personage, is in itself false.</p><p>It needs no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any deductions drawn from history.

  "page-903": "<p>Only by taking infinitesimally small units for observation (the differential of history, that is, the individual tendencies of men) and attaining to the art of integrating them (that is, finding the sum of these infinitesimals) can we hope to arrive at the laws of history.</p><p>The first fifteen years of the nineteenth century in Europe present an extraordinary movement of millions of people. Men leave their customary pursuits, hasten from one side of Europe to the other, plunder and slaughter one another, triumph and are plunged in despair, and for some years the whole course of life is altered and presents an intensive movement which first increases and then slackens.

And, indeed, human reason replies: every time conquerors appear there have been wars, but this does not prove that the conquerors caused the wars and that it is possible to find the laws of a war in the personal activity of a single man. Whenever I look at my watch and its hands point to ten, I hear the bells of the neighboring church; but because the bells begin to ring when the hands of the clock reach ten, I have no right to assume that the movement of the bells is caused by the position of the hands of the watch.</p>",

To that I must entirely change my point of view and study the laws of the movement of steam, of the bells, and of the wind. History must do the same. And attempts in this direction have already been made.</p><p>To study the laws of history we must completely change the subject of our observation, must leave aside kings, ministers, and generals, and study the common, infinitesimally small elements by which the masses are moved.</p>",

The French army pushed on to Moscow, its goal, its impetus ever increasing as it neared its aim, just as the velocity of a falling body increases as it approaches the earth. Behind it were seven hundred miles of hunger-stricken, hostile country; ahead were a few dozen miles separating it from its goal. Every soldier in Napoleon&rsquo;s army felt this and the invasion moved on by its own momentum.</p><p>The more the Russian army retreated the more fiercely a spirit of hatred of the enemy flared up, and while it retreated the army increased and consolidated.

For five weeks after that there was not a single battle. The French did not move.

Kutúzov reported so to the Emperor. He gave orders to prepare for a fresh conflict to finish the enemy and did this not to deceive anyone, but because he knew that the enemy was beaten, as everyone who had taken part in the battle knew it.</p><p>But all that evening and next day reports came in one after another of unheard-of losses, of the loss of half the army, and a fresh battle proved physically impossible.</p>",

Kutúzov&rsquo;s wish was to attack next day, and the whole army desired to do so. But to make an attack the wish to do so is not sufficient, there must also be a possibility of doing it, and that possibility did not exist. It was impossible not to retreat a day&rsquo;s march, and then in the same way it was impossible not to retreat another and a third day&rsquo;</p>",
  "page-914": "<p>s march, and at last, on the first of September when the army drew near Moscow&mdash;despite the strength of the feeling that had arisen in all ranks&mdash;the force of circumstances compelled it to retire beyond Moscow. And the troops retired one more, last, day&rsquo;s march, and abandoned Moscow to the enemy.</p><p>For people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles are made by generals&mdash;as anyone of us sitting over a map in his study may imagine how he would have arranged things in this or that battle&mdash;the questions present themselves: Why did Kutúzov during the retreat not do this or that? Why did he not take up a position before reaching Filí? Why did he not retire at once by the Kalúga road, abandoning Moscow? and so on.</p>",
  "page-915": "<p> People accustomed to think in that way forget, or do not know, the inevitable conditions which always limit the activities of any commander in chief. The activity of a commander in chief does not at all resemble the activity we imagine to ourselves when we sit at ease in our studies examining some campaign on the map, with a certain number of troops on this and that side in a certain known locality, and begin our plans from some given moment. A commander in chief is never dealing with the beginning of any event&mdash;the position from which we always contemplate it. The commander in chief is always in the midst of a series of shifting events and so he never can at any moment consider the whole import of an event that is occurring.</p>",
  "page-916": "<p> Moment by moment the event is imperceptibly shaping itself, and at every moment of this continuous, uninterrupted shaping of events the commander in chief is in the midst of a most complex play of intrigues, worries, contingencies, authorities, projects, counsels, threats, and deceptions and is continually obliged to reply to innumerable questions addressed to him, which constantly conflict with one another.</p><p>Learned military authorities quite seriously tell us that Kutúzov should have moved his army to the Kalúga road long before reaching Filí, and that somebody actually submitted such a proposal to him. But a commander in chief, especially at a difficult moment, has always before him not one proposal but dozens simultaneously. And all these proposals, based on strategics and tactics, contradict each other.</p>",
  "page-917": "<p>A commander in chief&rsquo;s business, it would seem, is simply to choose one of these projects. But even that he cannot do. Events and time do not wait. For instance, on the twenty-eighth it is suggested to him to cross to the Kalúga road, but just then an adjutant gallops up from Milorádovich asking whether he is to engage the French or retire. An order must be given him at once, that instant. And the order to retreat carries us past the turn to the Kalúga road. And after the adjutant comes the commissary general asking where the stores are to be taken, and the chief of the hospitals asks where the wounded are to go, and a courier from Petersburg brings a letter from the sovereign which does not admit of the possibility of abandoning Moscow, and the commander in chief&rsquo;</p>",
  "page-918": "<p>s rival, the man who is undermining him (and there are always not merely one but several such), presents a new project diametrically opposed to that of turning to the Kalúga road, and the commander in chief himself needs sleep and refreshment to maintain his energy and a respectable general who has been overlooked in the distribution of rewards comes to complain, and the inhabitants of the district pray to be defended, and an officer sent to inspect the locality comes in and gives a report quite contrary to what was said by the officer previously sent; and a spy, a prisoner, and a general who has been on reconnaissance, all describe the position of the enemy&rsquo;s army differently. People accustomed to misunderstand or to forget these inevitable conditions of a commander in chief&rsquo;</p>",
  "page-919": "<p>s actions describe to us, for instance, the position of the army at Filí and assume that the commander in chief could, on the first of September, quite freely decide whether to abandon Moscow or defend it; whereas, with the Russian army less than four miles from Moscow, no such question existed. When had that question been settled? At Drissa and at Smolénsk and most palpably of all on the twenty-fourth of August at Shevárdino and on the twenty-sixth at Borodinó, and each day and hour and minute of the retreat from Borodinó to Filí.</p>",
  "page-920": "<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>",
  "page-921": "<p>When Ermólov, having been sent by Kutúzov to inspect the position, told the field marshal that it was impossible to fight there before Moscow and that they must retreat, Kutúzov looked at him in silence.</p><p>&ldquo;Give me your hand,&rdquo; said he and, turning it over so as to feel the pulse, added: &ldquo;You are not well, my dear fellow. Think what you are saying!&rdquo;</p><p>Kutúzov could not yet admit the possibility of retreating beyond Moscow without a battle.</p><p>On the Poklónny Hill, four miles from the Dorogomílov gate of Moscow, Kutúzov got out of his carriage and sat down on a bench by the roadside. A great crowd of generals gathered round him, and Count Rostopchín, who had come out from Moscow, joined them.</p>",
  "page-922": "<p> This brilliant company separated into several groups who all discussed the advantages and disadvantages of the position, the state of the army, the plans suggested, the situation of Moscow, and military questions generally. Though they had not been summoned for the purpose, and though it was not so called, they all felt that this was really a council of war. The conversations all dealt with public questions. If anyone gave or asked for personal news, it was done in a whisper and they immediately reverted to general matters. No jokes, or laughter, or smiles even, were seen among all these men. They evidently all made an effort to hold themselves at the height the situation demanded. And all these groups, while talking among themselves, tried to keep near the commander in chief (whose bench formed the center of the gathering) and to speak so that he might overhear them.</p>",
  "page-923": "<p> The commander in chief listened to what was being said and sometimes asked them to repeat their remarks, but did not himself take part in the conversations or express any opinion. After hearing what was being said by one or other of these groups he generally turned away with an air of disappointment, as though they were not speaking of anything he wished to hear. Some discussed the position that had been chosen, criticizing not the position itself so much as the mental capacity of those who had chosen it. Others argued that a mistake had been made earlier and that a battle should have been fought two days before. Others again spoke of the battle of Salamanca, which was described by Crosart, a newly arrived Frenchman in a Spanish uniform. (This Frenchman and one of the German princes serving with the Russian army were discussing the siege of Saragossa and considering the possibility of defending Moscow in a similar manner.)</p>",
  "page-924": "<p> Count Rostopchín was telling a fourth group that he was prepared to die with the city train bands under the walls of the capital, but that he still could not help regretting having been left in ignorance of what was happening, and that had he known it sooner things would have been different.... A fifth group, displaying the profundity of their strategic perceptions, discussed the direction the troops would now have to take. A sixth group was talking absolute nonsense. Kutúzov&rsquo;s expression grew more and more preoccupied and gloomy. From all this talk he saw only one thing: that to defend Moscow was a physical impossibility in the full meaning of those words, that is to say, so utterly impossible that if any senseless commander were to give orders to fight, confusion would result but the battle would still not take place.</p>",
  "page-925": "<p> It would not take place because the commanders not merely all recognized the position to be impossible, but in their conversations were only discussing what would happen after its inevitable abandonment. How could the commanders lead their troops to a field of battle they considered impossible to hold? The lower-grade officers and even the soldiers (who too reason) also considered the position impossible and therefore could not go to fight, fully convinced as they were of defeat. If Bennigsen insisted on the position being defended and others still discussed it, the question was no longer important in itself but only as a pretext for disputes and intrigue. This Kutúzov knew well.</p><p>Bennigsen, who had chosen the position, warmly displayed his Russian patriotism (Kutúzov could not listen to this without wincing) by insisting that Moscow must be defended.</p>",
  "page-926": "<p> His aim was as clear as daylight to Kutúzov: if the defense failed, to throw the blame on Kutúzov who had brought the army as far as the Sparrow Hills without giving battle; if it succeeded, to claim the success as his own; or if battle were not given, to clear himself of the crime of abandoning Moscow. But this intrigue did not now occupy the old man&rsquo;s mind. One terrible question absorbed him and to that question he heard no reply from anyone. The question for him now was: &ldquo;Have I really allowed Napoleon to reach Moscow, and when did I do so? When was it decided? Can it have been yesterday when I ordered Plátov to retreat, or was it the evening before, when I had a nap and told Bennigsen to issue orders? Or was it earlier still?... When, when was this terrible affair decided? Moscow must be abandoned. The army must retreat and the order to do so must be given.</p>",
  "page-927": "<p>&rdquo; To give that terrible order seemed to him equivalent to resigning the command of the army. And not only did he love power to which he was accustomed (the honours awarded to Prince Prozoróvski, under whom he had served in Turkey, galled him), but he was convinced that he was destined to save Russia and that that was why, against the Emperor&rsquo;s wish and by the will of the people, he had been chosen commander in chief. He was convinced that he alone could maintain command of the army in these difficult circumstances, and that in all the world he alone could encounter the invincible Napoleon without fear, and he was horrified at the thought of the order he had to issue. But something had to be decided, and these conversations around him which were assuming too free a character must be stopped.</p>",
  "page-928": "<p>He called the most important generals to him.</p><p>&ldquo;My head, be it good or bad, must depend on itself,&rdquo; said he, rising from the bench, and he rode to Filí where his carriages were waiting.</p>",

  "page-930": "<p>The Council of War began to assemble at two in the afternoon in the better and roomier part of Andrew Savostyánov&rsquo;s hut. The men, women, and children of the large peasant family crowded into the back room across the passage. Only Malásha, Andrew&rsquo;s six-year-old granddaughter whom his Serene Highness had petted and to whom he had given a lump of sugar while drinking his tea, remained on the top of the brick oven in the larger room. Malásha looked down from the oven with shy delight at the faces, uniforms, and decorations of the generals, who one after another came into the room and sat down on the broad benches in the corner under the icons. &ldquo;Granddad&rdquo; himself, as Malásha in her own mind called Kutúzov, sat apart in a dark corner behind the oven.</p>",
  "page-931": "<p> He sat, sunk deep in a folding armchair, and continually cleared his throat and pulled at the collar of his coat which, though it was unbuttoned, still seemed to pinch his neck. Those who entered went up one by one to the field marshal; he pressed the hands of some and nodded to others. His adjutant Kaysárov was about to draw back the curtain of the window facing Kutúzov, but the latter moved his hand angrily and Kaysárov understood that his Serene Highness did not wish his face to be seen.</p><p>Round the peasant&rsquo;s deal table, on which lay maps, plans, pencils, and papers, so many people gathered that the orderlies brought in another bench and put it beside the table. Ermólov, Kaysárov, and Toll, who had just arrived, sat down on this bench.</p>",
  "page-932": "<p> In the foremost place, immediately under the icons, sat Barclay de Tolly, his high forehead merging into his bald crown. He had a St. George&rsquo;s Cross round his neck and looked pale and ill. He had been feverish for two days and was now shivering and in pain. Beside him sat Uvárov, who with rapid gesticulations was giving him some information, speaking in low tones as they all did. Chubby little Dokhtúrov was listening attentively with eyebrows raised and arms folded on his stomach. On the other side sat Count Ostermann-Tolstóy, seemingly absorbed in his own thoughts. His broad head with its bold features and glittering eyes was resting on his hand. Raévski, twitching forward the black hair on his temples as was his habit, glanced now at Kutúzov and now at the door with a look of impatience. Konovnítsyn&rsquo;s firm, handsome, and kindly face was lit up by a tender, sly smile. His glance met Malásha&rsquo;s, and the expression of his eyes caused the little girl to smile.</p>",
  "page-933": "<p>They were all waiting for Bennigsen, who on the pretext of inspecting the position was finishing his savory dinner. They waited for him from four till six o&rsquo;clock and did not begin their deliberations all that time but talked in low tones of other matters.</p><p>Only when Bennigsen had entered the hut did Kutúzov leave his corner and draw toward the table, but not near enough for the candles that had been placed there to light up his face.</p><p>Bennigsen opened the council with the question: &ldquo;Are we to abandon Russia&rsquo;s ancient and sacred capital without a struggle, or are we to defend it?&rdquo; A prolonged and general silence followed. There was a frown on every face and only Kutúzov&rsquo;s angry grunts and occasional cough broke the silence. All eyes were gazing at him. Malásha too looked at &ldquo;Granddad.</p>",
  "page-934": "<p>&rdquo; She was nearest to him and saw how his face puckered; he seemed about to cry, but this did not last long.</p><p>&ldquo;Russia&rsquo;s ancient and sacred capital!&rdquo; he suddenly said, repeating Bennigsen&rsquo;s words in an angry voice and thereby drawing attention to the false note in them. &ldquo;Allow me to tell you, your excellency, that that question has no meaning for a Russian.&rdquo; (He lurched his heavy body forward.) &ldquo;Such a question cannot be put; it is senseless! The question I have asked these gentlemen to meet to discuss is a military one. The question is that of saving Russia. Is it better to give up Moscow without a battle, or by accepting battle to risk losing the army as well as Moscow? That is the question on which I want your opinion,&rdquo; and he sank back in his chair.</p>",
  "page-935": "<p>The discussion began. Bennigsen did not yet consider his game lost. Admitting the view of Barclay and others that a defensive battle at Filí was impossible, but imbued with Russian patriotism and the love of Moscow, he proposed to move troops from the right to the left flank during the night and attack the French right flank the following day. Opinions were divided, and arguments were advanced for and against that project. Ermólov, Dokhtúrov, and Raévski agreed with Bennigsen. Whether feeling it necessary to make a sacrifice before abandoning the capital or guided by other, personal considerations, these generals seemed not to understand that this council could not alter the inevitable course of events and that Moscow was in effect already abandoned. The other generals, however, understood it and, leaving aside the question of Moscow, spoke of the direction the army should take in its retreat.</p>",
  "page-936": "<p> Malásha, who kept her eyes fixed on what was going on before her, understood the meaning of the council differently. It seemed to her that it was only a personal struggle between &ldquo;Granddad&rdquo; and &ldquo;Long-coat&rdquo; as she termed Bennigsen. She saw that they grew spiteful when they spoke to one another, and in her heart she sided with &ldquo;Granddad.&rdquo; In the midst of the conversation she noticed &ldquo;Granddad&rdquo; give Bennigsen a quick, subtle glance, and then to her joys she saw that &ldquo;Granddad&rdquo; said something to &ldquo;Long-coat&rdquo; which settled him. Bennigsen suddenly reddened and paced angrily up and down the room. What so affected him was Kutúzov&rsquo;s calm and quiet comment on the advantage or disadvantage of Bennigsen&rsquo;s proposal to move troops by night from the right to the left flank to attack the French right wing.</p>",
  "page-937": "<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Kutúzov, &ldquo;I cannot approve of the count&rsquo;s plan. Moving troops in close proximity to an enemy is always dangerous, and military history supports that view. For instance...&rdquo; Kutúzov seemed to reflect, searching for an example, then with a clear, naïve look at Bennigsen he added: &ldquo;Oh yes; take the battle of Friedland, which I think the count well remembers, and which was... not fully successful, only because our troops were rearranged too near the enemy....&rdquo;</p><p>There followed a momentary pause, which seemed very long to them all.</p><p>The discussion recommenced, but pauses frequently occurred and they all felt that there was no more to be said.</p>",
  "page-938": "<p>During one of these pauses Kutúzov heaved a deep sigh as if preparing to speak. They all looked at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, gentlemen, I see that it is I who will have to pay for the broken crockery,&rdquo; said he, and rising slowly he moved to the table. &ldquo;Gentlemen, I have heard your views. Some of you will not agree with me. But I,&rdquo; he paused, &ldquo;by the authority entrusted to me by my Sovereign and country, order a retreat.&rdquo;</p><p>After that the generals began to disperse with the solemnity and circumspect silence of people who are leaving, after a funeral.</p><p>Some of the generals, in low tones and in a strain very different from the way they had spoken during the council, communicated something to their commander in chief.</p>",
  "page-939": "<p>Malásha, who had long been expected for supper, climbed carefully backwards down from the oven, her bare little feet catching at its projections, and slipping between the legs of the generals she darted out of the room.</p><p>When he had dismissed the generals Kutúzov sat a long time with his elbows on the table, thinking always of the same terrible question: &ldquo;When, when did the abandonment of Moscow become inevitable? When was that done which settled the matter? And who was to blame for it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did not expect this,&rdquo; said he to his adjutant Schneider when the latter came in late that night. &ldquo;I did not expect this! I did not think this would happen.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-940": "<p>&ldquo;You should take some rest, your Serene Highness,&rdquo; replied Schneider.</p><p>&ldquo;But no! They shall eat horseflesh yet, like the Turks!&rdquo; exclaimed Kutúzov without replying, striking the table with his podgy fist. &ldquo;They shall too, if only...&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-941": "<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>",
  "page-942": "<p>At that very time, in circumstances even more important than retreating without a battle, namely the evacuation and burning of Moscow, Rostopchín, who is usually represented as being the instigator of that event, acted in an altogether different manner from Kutúzov.</p><p>After the battle of Borodinó the abandonment and burning of Moscow was as inevitable as the retreat of the army beyond Moscow without fighting.</p><p>Every Russian might have predicted it, not by reasoning but by the feeling implanted in each of us and in our fathers.</p><p>The same thing that took place in Moscow had happened in all the towns and villages on Russian soil beginning with Smolénsk, without the participation of Count Rostopchín and his broadsheets. The people awaited the enemy unconcernedly, did not riot or become excited or tear anyone to pieces, but faced its fate, feeling within it the strength to find what it should do at that most difficult moment.</p>",
  "page-943": "<p> And as soon as the enemy drew near the wealthy classes went away abandoning their property, while the poorer remained and burned and destroyed what was left.</p><p>The consciousness that this would be so and would always be so was and is present in the heart of every Russian. And a consciousness of this, and a foreboding that Moscow would be taken, was present in Russian Moscow society in 1812. Those who had quitted Moscow already in July and at the beginning of August showed that they expected this. Those who went away, taking what they could and abandoning their houses and half their belongings, did so from the latent patriotism which expresses itself not by phrases or by giving one&rsquo;s children to save the fatherland and similar unnatural exploits, but unobtrusively, simply, organically, and therefore in the way that always produces the most powerful results.</p>",
  "page-944": "<p>&ldquo;It is disgraceful to run away from danger; only cowards are running away from Moscow,&rdquo; they were told. In his broadsheets Rostopchín impressed on them that to leave Moscow was shameful. They were ashamed to be called cowards, ashamed to leave, but still they left, knowing it had to be done. Why did they go? It is impossible to suppose that Rostopchín had scared them by his accounts of horrors Napoleon had committed in conquered countries. The first people to go away were the rich educated people who knew quite well that Vienna and Berlin had remained intact and that during Napoleon&rsquo;s occupation the inhabitants had spent their time pleasantly in the company of the charming Frenchmen whom the Russians, and especially the Russian ladies, then liked so much.</p>",
  "page-945": "<p>They went away because for Russians there could be no question as to whether things would go well or ill under French rule in Moscow. It was out of the question to be under French rule, it would be the worst thing that could happen. They went away even before the battle of Borodinó and still more rapidly after it, despite Rostopchín&rsquo;s calls to defend Moscow or the announcement of his intention to take the wonder-working icon of the Iberian Mother of God and go to fight, or of the balloons that were to destroy the French, and despite all the nonsense Rostopchín wrote in his broadsheets. They knew that it was for the army to fight, and that if it could not succeed it would not do to take young ladies and house serfs to the Three Hills quarter of Moscow to fight Napoleon, and that they must go away, sorry as they were to abandon their property to destruction.</p>",
  "page-946": "<p> They went away without thinking of the tremendous significance of that immense and wealthy city being given over to destruction, for a great city with wooden buildings was certain when abandoned by its inhabitants to be burned. They went away each on his own account, and yet it was only in consequence of their going away that the momentous event was accomplished that will always remain the greatest glory of the Russian people. The lady who, afraid of being stopped by Count Rostopchín&rsquo;s orders, had already in June moved with her Negroes and her women jesters from Moscow to her Sarátov estate, with a vague consciousness that she was not Bonaparte&rsquo;s servant, was really, simply, and truly carrying out the great work which saved Russia. But Count Rostopchín, who now taunted those who left Moscow and now had the government offices removed; now distributed quite useless weapons to the drunken rabble;</p>",
  "page-947": "<p> now had processions displaying the icons, and now forbade Father Augustin to remove icons or the relics of saints; now seized all the private carts in Moscow and on one hundred and thirty-six of them removed the balloon that was being constructed by Leppich; now hinted that he would burn Moscow and related how he had set fire to his own house; now wrote a proclamation to the French solemnly upbraiding them for having destroyed his Orphanage; now claimed the glory of having hinted that he would burn Moscow and now repudiated the deed; now ordered the people to catch all spies and bring them to him, and now reproached them for doing so; now expelled all the French residents from Moscow, and now allowed Madame Aubert-Chalmé (the center of the whole French colony in Moscow) to remain, but ordered the venerable old postmaster Klyucharëv to be arrested and exiled for no particular offense;</p>",
  "page-948": "<p> now assembled the people at the Three Hills to fight the French and now, to get rid of them, handed over to them a man to be killed and himself drove away by a back gate; now declared that he would not survive the fall of Moscow, and now wrote French verses in albums concerning his share in the affair&mdash;this man did not understand the meaning of what was happening but merely wanted to do something himself that would astonish people, to perform some patriotically heroic feat; and like a child he made sport of the momentous, and unavoidable event&mdash;the abandonment and burning of Moscow&mdash;and tried with his puny hand now to speed and now to stay the enormous, popular tide that bore him along with it.</p>",

And as it always happens in contests of cunning that a stupid person gets the better of cleverer ones, Hélène&mdash;having realized that the main object of all these words and all this trouble was, after converting her to Catholicism, to obtain money from her for Jesuit institutions (as to which she received indications)&mdash;</p>",

That marriage lacked the dual significance it should have had. Yet in spite of this your vow was binding. You swerved from it. What did you commit by so acting? A venial, or a mortal, sin? A venial sin, for you acted without evil intention.</p>",

  "page-962": "<p>Hélène understood that the question was very simple and easy from the ecclesiastical point of view, and that her directors were making difficulties only because they were apprehensive as to how the matter would be regarded by the secular authorities.</p><p>So she decided that it was necessary to prepare the opinion of society. She provoked the jealousy of the elderly magnate and told him what she had told her other suitor; that is, she put the matter so that the only way for him to obtain a right over her was to marry her. The elderly magnate was at first as much taken aback by this suggestion of marriage with a woman whose husband was alive, as the younger man had been, but Hélène&rsquo;s imperturbable conviction that it was as simple and natural as marrying a maiden had its effect on him too.</p>",
  "page-963": "<p> Had Hélène herself shown the least sign of hesitation, shame, or secrecy, her cause would certainly have been lost; but not only did she show no signs of secrecy or shame, on the contrary, with good-natured naïveté she told her intimate friends (and these were all Petersburg) that both the prince and the magnate had proposed to her and that she loved both and was afraid of grieving either.</p><p>A rumor immediately spread in Petersburg, not that Hélène wanted to be divorced from her husband (had such a report spread many would have opposed so illegal an intention) but simply that the unfortunate and interesting Hélène was in doubt which of the two men she should marry. The question was no longer whether this was possible, but only which was the better match and how the matter would be regarded at court.</p>",
  "page-964": "<p> There were, it is true, some rigid individuals unable to rise to the height of such a question, who saw in the project a desecration of the sacrament of marriage, but there were not many such and they remained silent, while the majority were interested in Hélène&rsquo;s good fortune and in the question which match would be the more advantageous. Whether it was right or wrong to remarry while one had a husband living they did not discuss, for that question had evidently been settled by people &ldquo;wiser than you or me,&rdquo; as they said, and to doubt the correctness of that decision would be to risk exposing one&rsquo;s stupidity and incapacity to live in society.</p><p>Only Márya Dmítrievna Akhrosímova, who had come to Petersburg that summer to see one of her sons, allowed herself plainly to express an opinion contrary to the general one.</p>",
  "page-965": "<p> Meeting Hélène at a ball she stopped her in the middle of the room and, amid general silence, said in her gruff voice: &ldquo;So wives of living men have started marrying again! Perhaps you think you have invented a novelty? You have been forestalled, my dear! It was thought of long ago. It is done in all the brothels,&rdquo; and with these words Márya Dmítrievna, turning up her wide sleeves with her usual threatening gesture and glancing sternly round, moved across the room.</p><p>Though people were afraid of Márya Dmítrievna she was regarded in Petersburg as a buffoon, and so of what she had said they only noticed, and repeated in a whisper, the one coarse word she had used, supposing the whole sting of her remark to lie in that word.</p>",
  "page-966": "<p>Prince Vasíli, who of late very often forgot what he had said and repeated one and the same thing a hundred times, remarked to his daughter whenever he chanced to see her:</p><p>&ldquo;Hélène, I have a word to say to you,&rdquo; and he would lead her aside, drawing her hand downward. &ldquo;I have heard of certain projects concerning... you know. Well my dear child, you know how your father&rsquo;s heart rejoices to know that you... You have suffered so much.... But, my dear child, consult only your own heart. That is all I have to say,&rdquo; and concealing his unvarying emotion he would press his cheek against his daughter&rsquo;s and move away.</p>",
  "page-967": "<p>Bilíbin, who had not lost his reputation of an exceedingly clever man, and who was one of the disinterested friends so brilliant a woman as Hélène always has&mdash;men friends who can never change into lovers&mdash;once gave her his view of the matter at a small and intimate gathering.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen, Bilíbin,&rdquo; said Hélène (she always called friends of that sort by their surnames), and she touched his coat sleeve with her white, beringed fingers. &ldquo;Tell me, as you would a sister, what I ought to do. Which of the two?&rdquo;</p><p>Bilíbin wrinkled up the skin over his eyebrows and pondered, with a smile on his lips.</p>",
  "page-968": "<p>&ldquo;You are not taking me unawares, you know,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;As a true friend, I have thought and thought again about your affair. You see, if you marry the prince&rdquo;&mdash;he meant the younger man&mdash;and he crooked one finger, &ldquo;you forever lose the chance of marrying the other, and you will displease the court besides. (You know there is some kind of connection.) But if you marry the old count you will make his last days happy, and as widow of the Grand... the prince would no longer be making a mésalliance by marrying you,&rdquo; and Bilíbin smoothed out his forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a true friend!&rdquo; said Hélène beaming, and again touching Bilíbin&rsquo;s sleeve. &ldquo;But I love them, you know, and don&rsquo;t want to distress either of them. I would give my life for the happiness of them both.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-969": "<p>Bilíbin shrugged his shoulders, as much as to say that not even he could help in that difficulty.</p><p>&ldquo;Une maîtresse-femme! * That&rsquo;s what is called putting things squarely. She would like to be married to all three at the same time,&rdquo; thought he.</p><p>&ldquo;But tell me, how will your husband look at the matter?&rdquo; Bilíbin asked, his reputation being so well established that he did not fear to ask so naïve a question. &ldquo;Will he agree?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, he loves me so!&rdquo; said Hélène, who for some reason imagined that Pierre too loved her. &ldquo;He will do anything for me.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-970": "<p>Bilíbin puckered his skin in preparation for something witty.</p><p>&ldquo;Even divorce you?&rdquo; said he.</p><p>Hélène laughed.</p><p>Among those who ventured to doubt the justifiability of the proposed marriage was Hélène&rsquo;s mother, Princess Kurágina. She was continually tormented by jealousy of her daughter, and now that jealousy concerned a subject near to her own heart, she could not reconcile herself to the idea. She consulted a Russian priest as to the possibility of divorce and remarriage during a husband&rsquo;s lifetime, and the priest told her that it was impossible, and to her delight showed her a text in the Gospel which (as it seemed to him) plainly forbids remarriage while the husband is alive.</p>",
  "page-971": "<p>Armed with these arguments, which appeared to her unanswerable, she drove to her daughter&rsquo;s early one morning so as to find her alone.</p><p>Having listened to her mother&rsquo;s objections, Hélène smiled blandly and ironically.</p><p>&ldquo;But it says plainly: &lsquo;Whosoever shall marry her that is divorced...&rsquo;&rdquo; said the old princess.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, Maman, ne dites pas de bêtises. Vous ne comprenez rien. Dans ma position j&rsquo;ai des devoirs,&rdquo; * said Hélène changing from Russian, in which language she always felt that her case did not sound quite clear, into French which suited it better.</p>",
  "page-972": "<p>&ldquo;But, my dear....&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Mamma, how is it you don&rsquo;t understand that the Holy Father, who has the right to grant dispensations...&rdquo;</p><p>Just then the lady companion who lived with Hélène came in to announce that His Highness was in the ballroom and wished to see her.</p><p>&ldquo;Non, dites-lui que je ne veux pas le voir, que je suis furieuse contre lui, parce qu&rsquo;il m&rsquo;a manqué parole.&rdquo; *</p><p>&ldquo;Comtesse, à tout péché miséricorde,&rdquo; * said a fair-haired young man with a long face and nose, as he entered the room.</p>",
  "page-973": "<p>The old princess rose respectfully and curtsied. The young man who had entered took no notice of her. The princess nodded to her daughter and sidled out of the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, she is right,&rdquo; thought the old princess, all her convictions dissipated by the appearance of His Highness. &ldquo;She is right, but how is it that we in our irrecoverable youth did not know it? Yet it is so simple,&rdquo; she thought as she got into her carriage.</p><p>By the beginning of August Hélène&rsquo;s affairs were clearly defined and she wrote a letter to her husband&mdash;who, as she imagined, loved her very much&mdash;informing him of her intention to marry N.N. and of her having embraced the one true faith, and asking him to carry out all the formalities necessary for a divorce, which would be explained to him by the bearer of the letter.</p>",
  "page-974": "<p>And so I pray God to have you, my friend, in His holy and powerful keeping&mdash;Your friend Hélène.</p><p>This letter was brought to Pierre&rsquo;s house when he was on the field of Borodinó.</p>",
  "page-975": "<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>",
  "page-976": "<p>Toward the end of the battle of Borodinó, Pierre, having run down from Raévski&rsquo;s battery a second time, made his way through a gully to Knyazkóvo with a crowd of soldiers, reached the dressing station, and seeing blood and hearing cries and groans hurried on, still entangled in the crowds of soldiers.</p><p>The one thing he now desired with his whole soul was to get away quickly from the terrible sensations amid which he had lived that day and return to ordinary conditions of life and sleep quietly in a room in his own bed. He felt that only in the ordinary conditions of life would he be able to understand himself and all he had seen and felt. But such ordinary conditions of life were nowhere to be found.</p>",
  "page-977": "<p>Though shells and bullets did not whistle over the road along which he was going, still on all sides there was what there had been on the field of battle. There were still the same suffering, exhausted, and sometimes strangely indifferent faces, the same blood, the same soldiers&rsquo; overcoats, the same sounds of firing which, though distant now, still aroused terror, and besides this there were the foul air and the dust.</p><p>Having gone a couple of miles along the Mozháysk road, Pierre sat down by the roadside.</p><p>Dusk had fallen, and the roar of guns died away. Pierre lay leaning on his elbow for a long time, gazing at the shadows that moved past him in the darkness. He was continually imagining that a cannon ball was flying toward him with a terrific whizz, and then he shuddered and sat up. He had no idea how long he had been there.</p>",
  "page-978": "<p> In the middle of the night three soldiers, having brought some firewood, settled down near him and began lighting a fire.</p><p>The soldiers, who threw sidelong glances at Pierre, got the fire to burn and placed an iron pot on it into which they broke some dried bread and put a little dripping. The pleasant odor of greasy viands mingled with the smell of smoke. Pierre sat up and sighed. The three soldiers were eating and talking among themselves, taking no notice of him.</p><p>&ldquo;And who may you be?&rdquo; one of them suddenly asked Pierre, evidently meaning what Pierre himself had in mind, namely: &ldquo;If you want to eat we&rsquo;ll give you some food, only let us know whether you are an honest man.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-979": "<p>&ldquo;I, I...&rdquo; said Pierre, feeling it necessary to minimize his social position as much as possible so as to be nearer to the soldiers and better understood by them. &ldquo;By rights I am a militia officer, but my men are not here. I came to the battle and have lost them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There now!&rdquo; said one of the soldiers.</p><p>Another shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Would you like a little mash?&rdquo; the first soldier asked, and handed Pierre a wooden spoon after licking it clean.</p><p>Pierre sat down by the fire and began eating the mash, as they called the food in the cauldron, and he thought it more delicious than any food he had ever tasted. As he sat bending greedily over it, helping himself to large spoonfuls and chewing one after another, his face was lit up by the fire and the soldiers looked at him in silence.</p>",
  "page-980": "<p>&ldquo;Where have you to go to? Tell us!&rdquo; said one of them.</p><p>&ldquo;To Mozháysk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a gentleman, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter Kirílych.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then, Peter Kirílych, come along with us, we&rsquo;ll take you there.&rdquo;</p><p>In the total darkness the soldiers walked with Pierre to Mozháysk.</p>",
  "page-981": "<p>By the time they got near Mozháysk and began ascending the steep hill into the town, the cocks were already crowing. Pierre went on with the soldiers, quite forgetting that his inn was at the bottom of the hill and that he had already passed it. He would not soon have remembered this, such was his state of forgetfulness, had he not halfway up the hill stumbled upon his groom, who had been to look for him in the town and was returning to the inn. The groom recognized Pierre in the darkness by his white hat.</p><p>&ldquo;Your excellency!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why, we were beginning to despair! How is it you are on foot? And where are you going, please?&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-982": "<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; said Pierre.</p><p>The soldiers stopped.</p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve found your folk?&rdquo; said one of them. &ldquo;Well, good-by, Peter Kirílych&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good-by, Peter Kirílych!&rdquo; Pierre heard the other voices repeat.</p><p>&ldquo;Good-by!&rdquo; he said and turned with his groom toward the inn.</p><p>&ldquo;I ought to give them something!&rdquo; he thought, and felt in his pocket. &ldquo;No, better not!&rdquo; said another, inner voice.</p><p>There was not a room to be had at the inn, they were all occupied. Pierre went out into the yard and, covering himself up head and all, lay down in his carriage.</p>",
  "page-983": "<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>",
  "page-984": "<p>Scarcely had Pierre laid his head on the pillow before he felt himself falling asleep, but suddenly, almost with the distinctness of reality, he heard the boom, boom, boom of firing, the thud of projectiles, groans and cries, and smelled blood and powder, and a feeling of horror and dread of death seized him. Filled with fright he opened his eyes and lifted his head from under his cloak. All was tranquil in the yard. Only someone&rsquo;s orderly passed through the gateway, splashing through the mud, and talked to the innkeeper. Above Pierre&rsquo;s head some pigeons, disturbed by the movement he had made in sitting up, fluttered under the dark roof of the penthouse. The whole courtyard was permeated by a strong peaceful smell of stable yards, delightful to Pierre at that moment. He could see the clear starry sky between the dark roofs of two penthouses.</p>",
  "page-985": "<p>&ldquo;Thank God, there is no more of that!&rdquo; he thought, covering up his head again. &ldquo;Oh, what a terrible thing is fear, and how shamefully I yielded to it! But they... they were steady and calm all the time, to the end...&rdquo; thought he.</p><p>They, in Pierre&rsquo;s mind, were the soldiers, those who had been at the battery, those who had given him food, and those who had prayed before the icon. They, those strange men he had not previously known, stood out clearly and sharply from everyone else.</p><p>&ldquo;To be a soldier, just a soldier!&rdquo; thought Pierre as he fell asleep, &ldquo;to enter communal life completely, to be imbued by what makes them what they are. But how cast off all the superfluous, devilish burden of my outer man? There was a time when I could have done it. I could have run away from my father, as I wanted to.</p>",
  "page-986": "<p> Or I might have been sent to serve as a soldier after the duel with Dólokhov.&rdquo; And the memory of the dinner at the English Club when he had challenged Dólokhov flashed through Pierre&rsquo;s mind, and then he remembered his benefactor at Torzhók. And now a picture of a solemn meeting of the lodge presented itself to his mind. It was taking place at the English Club and someone near and dear to him sat at the end of the table. &ldquo;Yes, that is he! It is my benefactor. But he died!&rdquo; thought Pierre. &ldquo;Yes, he died, and I did not know he was alive. How sorry I am that he died, and how glad I am that he is alive again!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-987": "<p> On one side of the table sat Anatole, Dólokhov, Nesvítski, Denísov, and others like them (in his dream the category to which these men belonged was as clearly defined in his mind as the category of those he termed they), and he heard those people, Anatole and Dólokhov, shouting and singing loudly; yet through their shouting the voice of his benefactor was heard speaking all the time and the sound of his words was as weighty and uninterrupted as the booming on the battlefield, but pleasant and comforting. Pierre did not understand what his benefactor was saying, but he knew (the categories of thoughts were also quite distinct in his dream) that he was talking of goodness and the possibility of being what they were. And they with their simple, kind, firm faces surrounded his benefactor on all sides. But though they were kindly they did not look at Pierre and did not know him.</p>",
  "page-988": "<p> Wishing to speak and to attract their attention, he got up, but at that moment his legs grew cold and bare.</p><p>He felt ashamed, and with one arm covered his legs from which his cloak had in fact slipped. For a moment as he was rearranging his cloak Pierre opened his eyes and saw the same penthouse roofs, posts, and yard, but now they were all bluish, lit up, and glittering with frost or dew.</p><p>&ldquo;It is dawn,&rdquo; thought Pierre. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not what I want. I want to hear and understand my benefactor&rsquo;s words.&rdquo; Again he covered himself up with his cloak, but now neither the lodge nor his benefactor was there. There were only thoughts clearly expressed in words, thoughts that someone was uttering or that he himself was formulating.</p>",
  "page-989": "<p>Afterwards when he recalled those thoughts Pierre was convinced that someone outside himself had spoken them, though the impressions of that day had evoked them. He had never, it seemed to him, been able to think and express his thoughts like that when awake.</p><p>&ldquo;To endure war is the most difficult subordination of man&rsquo;s freedom to the law of God,&rdquo; the voice had said. &ldquo;Simplicity is submission to the will of God; you cannot escape from Him. And they are simple. They do not talk, but act. The spoken word is silver but the unspoken is golden. Man can be master of nothing while he fears death, but he who does not fear it possesses all. If there were no suffering, man would not know his limitations, would not know himself. The hardest thing (Pierre went on thinking, or hearing, in his dream) is to be able in your soul to unite the meaning of all. To unite all?&rdquo; he asked himself.</p>",
  "page-990": "<p> &ldquo;No, not to unite. Thoughts cannot be united, but to harness all these thoughts together is what we need! Yes, one must harness them, must harness them!&rdquo; he repeated to himself with inward rapture, feeling that these words and they alone expressed what he wanted to say and solved the question that tormented him.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, one must harness, it is time to harness.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Time to harness, time to harness, your excellency! Your excellency!&rdquo; some voice was repeating. &ldquo;We must harness, it is time to harness....&rdquo;</p><p>It was the voice of the groom, trying to wake him. The sun shone straight into Pierre&rsquo;s face. He glanced at the dirty innyard in the middle of which soldiers were watering their lean horses at the pump while carts were passing out of the gate. Pierre turned away with repugnance, and closing his eyes quickly fell back on the carriage seat.</p>",
  "page-991": "<p> &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want that, I don&rsquo;t want to see and understand that. I want to understand what was revealing itself to me in my dream. One second more and I should have understood it all! But what am I to do? Harness, but how can I harness everything?&rdquo; and Pierre felt with horror that the meaning of all he had seen and thought in the dream had been destroyed.</p><p>The groom, the coachman, and the innkeeper told Pierre that an officer had come with news that the French were already near Mozháysk and that our men were leaving it.</p><p>Pierre got up and, having told them to harness and overtake him, went on foot through the town.</p>",
  "page-992": "<p>The troops were moving on, leaving about ten thousand wounded behind them. There were wounded in the yards, at the windows of the houses, and the streets were crowded with them. In the streets, around carts that were to take some of the wounded away, shouts, curses, and blows could be heard. Pierre offered the use of his carriage, which had overtaken him, to a wounded general he knew, and drove with him to Moscow. On the way Pierre was told of the death of his brother-in-law Anatole and of that of Prince Andrew.</p>",
  "page-993": "<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>",
  "page-994": "<p>On the thirtieth of August Pierre reached Moscow. Close to the gates of the city he was met by Count Rostopchín&rsquo;s adjutant.</p><p>&ldquo;We have been looking for you everywhere,&rdquo; said the adjutant. &ldquo;The count wants to see you particularly. He asks you to come to him at once on a very important matter.&rdquo;</p><p>Without going home, Pierre took a cab and drove to see the Moscow commander in chief.</p><p>Count Rostopchín had only that morning returned to town from his summer villa at Sokólniki. The anteroom and reception room of his house were full of officials who had been summoned or had come for orders. Vasílchikov and Plátov had already seen the count and explained to him that it was impossible to defend Moscow and that it would have to be surrendered.</p>",
  "page-995": "<p> Though this news was being concealed from the inhabitants, the officials&mdash;the heads of the various government departments&mdash;knew that Moscow would soon be in the enemy&rsquo;s hands, just as Count Rostopchín himself knew it, and to escape personal responsibility they had all come to the governor to ask how they were to deal with their various departments.</p><p>As Pierre was entering the reception room a courier from the army came out of Rostopchín&rsquo;s private room.</p><p>In answer to questions with which he was greeted, the courier made a despairing gesture with his hand and passed through the room.</p><p>While waiting in the reception room Pierre with weary eyes watched the various officials, old and young, military and civilian, who were there. They all seemed dissatisfied and uneasy. Pierre went up to a group of men, one of whom he knew. After greeting Pierre they continued their conversation.</p>",
  "page-996": "<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re sent out and brought back again later on it will do no harm, but as things are now one can&rsquo;t answer for anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you see what he writes...&rdquo; said another, pointing to a printed sheet he held in his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s another matter. That&rsquo;s necessary for the people,&rdquo; said the first.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a fresh broadsheet.&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre took it and began reading.</p><p>His Serene Highness has passed through Mozháysk in order to join up with the troops moving toward him and has taken up a strong position where the enemy will not soon attack him. Forty-eight guns with ammunition have been sent him from here, and his Serene Highness says he will defend Moscow to the last drop of blood and is even ready to fight in the streets.</p>",
  "page-997": "<p> Do not be upset, brothers, that the law courts are closed; things have to be put in order, and we will deal with villains in our own way! When the time comes I shall want both town and peasant lads and will raise the cry a day or two beforehand, but they are not wanted yet so I hold my peace. An ax will be useful, a hunting spear not bad, but a three-pronged fork will be best of all: a Frenchman is no heavier than a sheaf of rye. Tomorrow after dinner I shall take the Iberian icon of the Mother of God to the wounded in the Catherine Hospital where we will have some water blessed. That will help them to get well quicker. I, too, am well now: one of my eyes was sore but now I am on the lookout with both.</p>",
  "page-998": "<p>&ldquo;But military men have told me that it is impossible to fight in the town,&rdquo; said Pierre, &ldquo;and that the position...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, of course! That&rsquo;s what we were saying,&rdquo; replied the first speaker.</p><p>&ldquo;And what does he mean by &lsquo;One of my eyes was sore but now I am on the lookout with both&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;The count had a sty,&rdquo; replied the adjutant smiling, &ldquo;and was very much upset when I told him people had come to ask what was the matter with him. By the by, Count,&rdquo; he added suddenly, addressing Pierre with a smile, &ldquo;we heard that you have family troubles and that the countess, your wife...&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-999": "<p>&ldquo;I have heard nothing,&rdquo; Pierre replied unconcernedly. &ldquo;But what have you heard?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, well, you know people often invent things. I only say what I heard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But what did you hear?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, they say,&rdquo; continued the adjutant with the same smile, &ldquo;that the countess, your wife, is preparing to go abroad. I expect it&rsquo;s nonsense....&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; remarked Pierre, looking about him absent-mindedly. &ldquo;And who is that?&rdquo; he asked, indicating a short old man in a clean blue peasant overcoat, with a big snow-white beard and eyebrows and a ruddy face.</p>",
  "page-1000": "<p>&ldquo;He? That&rsquo;s a tradesman, that is to say, he&rsquo;s the restaurant keeper, Vereshchágin. Perhaps you have heard of that affair with the proclamation.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, so that is Vereshchágin!&rdquo; said Pierre, looking at the firm, calm face of the old man and seeking any indication of his being a traitor.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not he himself, that&rsquo;s the father of the fellow who wrote the proclamation,&rdquo; said the adjutant. &ldquo;The young man is in prison and I expect it will go hard with him.&rdquo;</p><p>An old gentleman wearing a star and another official, a German wearing a cross round his neck, approached the speaker.</p>",
  "page-1001": "<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a complicated story, you know,&rdquo; said the adjutant. &ldquo;That proclamation appeared about two months ago. The count was informed of it. He gave orders to investigate the matter. Gabriel Ivánovich here made the inquiries. The proclamation had passed through exactly sixty-three hands. He asked one, &lsquo;From whom did you get it?&rsquo; &lsquo;From so-and-so.&rsquo; He went to the next one. &lsquo;From whom did you get it?&rsquo; and so on till he reached Vereshchágin, a half educated tradesman, you know, &lsquo;a pet of a trader,&rsquo;&rdquo; said the adjutant smiling. &ldquo;They asked him, &lsquo;Who gave it you?&rsquo; And the point is that we knew whom he had it from. He could only have had it from the Postmaster. But evidently they had come to some understanding. He replied: &lsquo;From no one; I made it up myself.</p>",
  "page-1002": "<p>&rsquo; They threatened and questioned him, but he stuck to that: &lsquo;I made it up myself.&rsquo; And so it was reported to the count, who sent for the man. ‘From whom did you get the proclamation?&rsquo; &lsquo;I wrote it myself.&rsquo; Well, you know the count,&rdquo; said the adjutant cheerfully, with a smile of pride, &ldquo;he flared up dreadfully&mdash;and just think of the fellow&rsquo;s audacity, lying, and obstinacy!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And the count wanted him to say it was from Klyucharëv? I understand!&rdquo; said Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; rejoined the adjutant in dismay. &ldquo;Klyucharëv had his own sins to answer for without that and that is why he has been banished. But the point is that the count was much annoyed. &lsquo;How could you have written it yourself?&rsquo; said he, and he took up the Hamburg Gazette that was lying on the table.</p>",
  "page-1003": "<p> &lsquo;Here it is! You did not write it yourself but translated it, and translated it abominably, because you don&rsquo;t even know French, you fool.&rsquo; And what do you think? &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I have not read any papers, I made it up myself.&rsquo; &lsquo;If that&rsquo;s so, you&rsquo;re a traitor and I&rsquo;ll have you tried, and you&rsquo;ll be hanged! Say from whom you had it.&rsquo; &lsquo;I have seen no papers, I made it up myself.&rsquo; And that was the end of it. The count had the father fetched, but the fellow stuck to it. He was sent for trial and condemned to hard labor, I believe. Now the father has come to intercede for him. But he&rsquo;s a good-for-nothing lad! You know that sort of tradesman&rsquo;s son, a dandy and lady-killer. He attended some lectures somewhere and imagines that the devil is no match for him. That&rsquo;s the sort of fellow he is.</p>",
  "page-1004": "<p> His father keeps a cookshop here by the Stone Bridge, and you know there was a large icon of God Almighty painted with a scepter in one hand and an orb in the other. Well, he took that icon home with him for a few days and what did he do? He found some scoundrel of a painter...&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1005": "<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>",
  "page-1006": "<p>In the middle of this fresh tale Pierre was summoned to the commander in chief.</p><p>When he entered the private room Count Rostopchín, puckering his face, was rubbing his forehead and eyes with his hand. A short man was saying something, but when Pierre entered he stopped speaking and went out.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, how do you do, great warrior?&rdquo; said Rostopchín as soon as the short man had left the room. &ldquo;We have heard of your prowess. But that&rsquo;s not the point. Between ourselves, mon cher, do you belong to the Masons?&rdquo; he went on severely, as though there were something wrong about it which he nevertheless intended to pardon. Pierre remained silent. &ldquo;I am well informed, my friend, but I am aware that there are Masons and I hope that you are not one of those who on pretense of saving mankind wish to ruin Russia.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1007": "<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am a Mason,&rdquo; Pierre replied.</p><p>&ldquo;There, you see, mon cher! I expect you know that Messrs. Speránski and Magnítski have been deported to their proper place. Mr. Klyucharëv has been treated in the same way, and so have others who on the plea of building up the temple of Solomon have tried to destroy the temple of their fatherland. You can understand that there are reasons for this and that I could not have exiled the Postmaster had he not been a harmful person. It has now come to my knowledge that you lent him your carriage for his removal from town, and that you have even accepted papers from him for safe custody. I like you and don&rsquo;t wish you any harm and&mdash;as you are only half my age&mdash;I advise you, as a father would, to cease all communication with men of that stamp and to leave here as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1008": "<p>&ldquo;But what did Klyucharëv do wrong, Count?&rdquo; asked Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;That is for me to know, but not for you to ask,&rdquo; shouted Rostopchín.</p><p>&ldquo;If he is accused of circulating Napoleon&rsquo;s proclamation it is not proved that he did so,&rdquo; said Pierre without looking at Rostopchín, &ldquo;and Vereshchágin...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There we are!&rdquo; Rostopchín shouted at Pierre louder than before, frowning suddenly. &ldquo;Vereshchágin is a renegade and a traitor who will be punished as he deserves,&rdquo; said he with the vindictive heat with which people speak when recalling an insult. &ldquo;But I did not summon you to discuss my actions, but to give you advice&mdash;or an order if you prefer it. I beg you to leave the town and break off all communication with such men as Klyucharëv.</p>",
  "page-1009": "<p> And I will knock the nonsense out of anybody&rdquo;&mdash;but probably realizing that he was shouting at Bezúkhov who so far was not guilty of anything, he added, taking Pierre&rsquo;s hand in a friendly manner, &ldquo;We are on the eve of a public disaster and I haven&rsquo;t time to be polite to everybody who has business with me. My head is sometimes in a whirl. Well, mon cher, what are you doing personally?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, nothing,&rdquo; answered Pierre without raising his eyes or changing the thoughtful expression of his face.</p><p>The count frowned.</p><p>&ldquo;A word of friendly advice, mon cher. Be off as soon as you can, that&rsquo;s all I have to tell you. Happy he who has ears to hear. Good-by, my dear fellow.</p>",
  "page-1010": "<p> Oh, by the by!&rdquo; he shouted through the doorway after Pierre, &ldquo;is it true that the countess has fallen into the clutches of the holy fathers of the Society of Jesus?&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre did not answer and left Rostopchín&rsquo;s room more sullen and angry than he had ever before shown himself.</p><p>When he reached home it was already getting dark. Some eight people had come to see him that evening: the secretary of a committee, the colonel of his battalion, his steward, his major-domo, and various petitioners. They all had business with Pierre and wanted decisions from him. Pierre did not understand and was not interested in any of these questions and only answered them in order to get rid of these people. When left alone at last he opened and read his wife&rsquo;s letter.</p>",
  "page-1011": "<p>&ldquo;They, the soldiers at the battery, Prince Andrew killed... that old man... Simplicity is submission to God. Suffering is necessary... the meaning of all... one must harness... my wife is getting married... One must forget and understand...&rdquo; And going to his bed he threw himself on it without undressing and immediately fell asleep.</p><p>When he awoke next morning the major-domo came to inform him that a special messenger, a police officer, had come from Count Rostopchín to know whether Count Bezúkhov had left or was leaving the town.</p><p>A dozen persons who had business with Pierre were awaiting him in the drawing room. Pierre dressed hurriedly and, instead of going to see them, went to the back porch and out through the gate.</p>",
  "page-1012": "<p>From that time till the end of the destruction of Moscow no one of Bezúkhov&rsquo;s household, despite all the search they made, saw Pierre again or knew where he was.</p>",
  "page-1013": "<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>",
  "page-1014": "<p>The Rostóvs remained in Moscow till the first of September, that is, till the eve of the enemy&rsquo;s entry into the city.</p><p>After Pétya had joined Obolénski&rsquo;s regiment of Cossacks and left for Bélaya Tsérkov where that regiment was forming, the countess was seized with terror. The thought that both her sons were at the war, had both gone from under her wing, that today or tomorrow either or both of them might be killed like the three sons of one of her acquaintances, struck her that summer for the first time with cruel clearness. She tried to get Nicholas back and wished to go herself to join Pétya, or to get him an appointment somewhere in Petersburg, but neither of these proved possible. Pétya could not return unless his regiment did so or unless he was transferred to another regiment on active service.</p>",
  "page-1015": "<p> Nicholas was somewhere with the army and had not sent a word since his last letter, in which he had given a detailed account of his meeting with Princess Mary. The countess did not sleep at night, or when she did fall asleep dreamed that she saw her sons lying dead. After many consultations and conversations, the count at last devised means to tranquillize her. He got Pétya transferred from Obolénski&rsquo;s regiment to Bezúkhov&rsquo;s, which was in training near Moscow. Though Pétya would remain in the service, this transfer would give the countess the consolation of seeing at least one of her sons under her wing, and she hoped to arrange matters for her Pétya so as not to let him go again, but always get him appointed to places where he could not possibly take part in a battle.</p>",
  "page-1016": "<p> As long as Nicholas alone was in danger the countess imagined that she loved her first-born more than all her other children and even reproached herself for it; but when her youngest: the scapegrace who had been bad at lessons, was always breaking things in the house and making himself a nuisance to everybody, that snub-nosed Pétya with his merry black eyes and fresh rosy cheeks where soft down was just beginning to show&mdash;when he was thrown amid those big, dreadful, cruel men who were fighting somewhere about something and apparently finding pleasure in it&mdash;then his mother thought she loved him more, much more, than all her other children. The nearer the time came for Pétya to return, the more uneasy grew the countess. She began to think she would never live to see such happiness. The presence of Sónya, of her beloved Natásha, or even of her husband irritated her. &ldquo;What do I want with them? I want no one but Pétya,&rdquo; she thought.</p>",
  "page-1017": "<p>At the end of August the Rostóvs received another letter from Nicholas. He wrote from the province of Vorónezh where he had been sent to procure remounts, but that letter did not set the countess at ease. Knowing that one son was out of danger she became the more anxious about Pétya.</p><p>Though by the twentieth of August nearly all the Rostóvs&rsquo; acquaintances had left Moscow, and though everybody tried to persuade the countess to get away as quickly as possible, she would not hear of leaving before her treasure, her adored Pétya, returned. On the twenty-eighth of August he arrived. The passionate tenderness with which his mother received him did not please the sixteen-year-old officer. Though she concealed from him her intention of keeping him under her wing, Pétya guessed her designs, and instinctively fearing that he might give way to emotion when with her&mdash;</p>",
  "page-1018": "<p>might &ldquo;become womanish&rdquo; as he termed it to himself&mdash;he treated her coldly, avoided her, and during his stay in Moscow attached himself exclusively to Natásha for whom he had always had a particularly brotherly tenderness, almost lover-like.</p><p>Owing to the count&rsquo;s customary carelessness nothing was ready for their departure by the twenty-eighth of August and the carts that were to come from their Ryazán and Moscow estates to remove their household belongings did not arrive till the thirtieth.</p><p>From the twenty-eighth till the thirty-first all Moscow was in a bustle and commotion. Every day thousands of men wounded at Borodinó were brought in by the Dorogomílov gate and taken to various parts of Moscow, and thousands of carts conveyed the inhabitants and their possessions out by the other gates.</p>",
  "page-1019": "<p> In spite of Rostopchín&rsquo;s broadsheets, or because of them or independently of them, the strangest and most contradictory rumors were current in the town. Some said that no one was to be allowed to leave the city, others on the contrary said that all the icons had been taken out of the churches and everybody was to be ordered to leave. Some said there had been another battle after Borodinó at which the French had been routed, while others on the contrary reported that the Russian army had been destroyed. Some talked about the Moscow militia which, preceded by the clergy, would go to the Three Hills; others whispered that Augustin had been forbidden to leave, that traitors had been seized, that the peasants were rioting and robbing people on their way from Moscow, and so on.</p>",
  "page-1020": "<p> But all this was only talk; in reality (though the Council of Filí, at which it was decided to abandon Moscow, had not yet been held) both those who went away and those who remained behind felt, though they did not show it, that Moscow would certainly be abandoned, and that they ought to get away as quickly as possible and save their belongings. It was felt that everything would suddenly break up and change, but up to the first of September nothing had done so. As a criminal who is being led to execution knows that he must die immediately, but yet looks about him and straightens the cap that is awry on his head, so Moscow involuntarily continued its wonted life, though it knew that the time of its destruction was near when the conditions of life to which its people were accustomed to submit would be completely upset.</p>",
  "page-1021": "<p>During the three days preceding the occupation of Moscow the whole Rostóv family was absorbed in various activities. The head of the family, Count Ilyá Rostóv, continually drove about the city collecting the current rumors from all sides and gave superficial and hasty orders at home about the preparations for their departure.</p><p>The countess watched the things being packed, was dissatisfied with everything, was constantly in pursuit of Pétya who was always running away from her, and was jealous of Natásha with whom he spent all his time. Sónya alone directed the practical side of matters by getting things packed. But of late Sónya had been particularly sad and silent. Nicholas&rsquo; letter in which he mentioned Princess Mary had elicited, in her presence, joyous comments from the countess, who saw an intervention of Providence in this meeting of the princess and Nicholas.</p>",
  "page-1022": "<p>&ldquo;I was never pleased at Bolkónski&rsquo;s engagement to Natásha,&rdquo; said the countess, &ldquo;but I always wanted Nicholas to marry the princess, and had a presentiment that it would happen. What a good thing it would be!&rdquo;</p><p>Sónya felt that this was true: that the only possibility of retrieving the Rostóvs&rsquo; affairs was by Nicholas marrying a rich woman, and that the princess was a good match. It was very bitter for her. But despite her grief, or perhaps just because of it, she took on herself all the difficult work of directing the storing and packing of their things and was busy for whole days. The count and countess turned to her when they had any orders to give. Pétya and Natásha on the contrary, far from helping their parents, were generally a nuisance and a hindrance to everyone.</p>",
  "page-1023": "<p> Almost all day long the house resounded with their running feet, their cries, and their spontaneous laughter. They laughed and were gay not because there was any reason to laugh, but because gaiety and mirth were in their hearts and so everything that happened was a cause for gaiety and laughter to them. Pétya was in high spirits because having left home a boy he had returned (as everybody told him) a fine young man, because he was at home, because he had left Bélaya Tsérkov where there was no hope of soon taking part in a battle and had come to Moscow where there was to be fighting in a few days, and chiefly because Natásha, whose lead he always followed, was in high spirits. Natásha was gay because she had been sad too long and now nothing reminded her of the cause of her sadness, and because she was feeling well.</p>",
  "page-1024": "<p> She was also happy because she had someone to adore her: the adoration of others was a lubricant the wheels of her machine needed to make them run freely&mdash;and Pétya adored her. Above all, they were gay because there was a war near Moscow, there would be fighting at the town gates, arms were being given out, everybody was escaping&mdash;going away somewhere, and in general something extraordinary was happening, and that is always exciting, especially to the young.</p>",
  "page-1025": "<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>",
  "page-1026": "<p>On Saturday, the thirty-first of August, everything in the Rostóvs&rsquo; house seemed topsy-turvy. All the doors were open, all the furniture was being carried out or moved about, and the mirrors and pictures had been taken down. There were trunks in the rooms, and hay, wrapping paper, and ropes were scattered about. The peasants and house serfs carrying out the things were treading heavily on the parquet floors. The yard was crowded with peasant carts, some loaded high and already corded up, others still empty.</p><p>The voices and footsteps of the many servants and of the peasants who had come with the carts resounded as they shouted to one another in the yard and in the house. The count had been out since morning. The countess had a headache brought on by all the noise and turmoil and was lying down in the new sitting room with a vinegar compress on her head.</p>",
  "page-1027": "<p> Pétya was not at home, he had gone to visit a friend with whom he meant to obtain a transfer from the militia to the active army. Sónya was in the ballroom looking after the packing of the glass and china. Natásha was sitting on the floor of her dismantled room with dresses, ribbons, and scarves strewn all about her, gazing fixedly at the floor and holding in her hands the old ball dress (already out of fashion) which she had worn at her first Petersburg ball.</p><p>Natásha was ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy, and several times that morning had tried to set to work, but her heart was not in it, and she could not and did not know how to do anything except with all her heart and all her might.</p>",
  "page-1028": "<p> For a while she had stood beside Sónya while the china was being packed and tried to help, but soon gave it up and went to her room to pack her own things. At first she found it amusing to give away dresses and ribbons to the maids, but when that was done and what was left had still to be packed, she found it dull.</p><p>&ldquo;Dunyásha, you pack! You will, won&rsquo;t you, dear?&rdquo; And when Dunyásha willingly promised to do it all for her, Natásha sat down on the floor, took her old ball dress, and fell into a reverie quite unrelated to what ought to have occupied her thoughts now. She was roused from her reverie by the talk of the maids in the next room (which was theirs) and by the sound of their hurried footsteps going to the back porch. Natásha got up and looked out of the window. An enormously long row of carts full of wounded men had stopped in the street.</p>",
  "page-1029": "<p>The housekeeper, the old nurse, the cooks, coachmen, maids, footmen, postilions, and scullions stood at the gate, staring at the wounded.</p><p>Natásha, throwing a clean pocket handkerchief over her hair and holding an end of it in each hand, went out into the street.</p><p>The former housekeeper, old Mávra Kuzmínichna, had stepped out of the crowd by the gate, gone up to a cart with a hood constructed of bast mats, and was speaking to a pale young officer who lay inside. Natásha moved a few steps forward and stopped shyly, still holding her handkerchief, and listened to what the housekeeper was saying.</p><p>&ldquo;Then you have nobody in Moscow?&rdquo; she was saying. &ldquo;You would be more comfortable somewhere in a house... in ours, for instance... the family are leaving.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1030": "<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if it would be allowed,&rdquo; replied the officer in a weak voice. &ldquo;Here is our commanding officer... ask him,&rdquo; and he pointed to a stout major who was walking back along the street past the row of carts.</p><p>Natásha glanced with frightened eyes at the face of the wounded officer and at once went to meet the major.</p><p>&ldquo;May the wounded men stay in our house?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>The major raised his hand to his cap with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Which one do you want, Ma&rsquo;am&rsquo;selle?&rdquo; said he, screwing up his eyes and smiling.</p>",
  "page-1031": "<p>Natásha quietly repeated her question, and her face and whole manner were so serious, though she was still holding the ends of her handkerchief, that the major ceased smiling and after some reflection&mdash;as if considering in how far the thing was possible&mdash;replied in the affirmative.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yes, why not? They may,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>With a slight inclination of her head, Natásha stepped back quickly to Mávra Kuzmínichna, who stood talking compassionately to the officer.</p><p>&ldquo;They may. He says they may!&rdquo; whispered Natásha.</p><p>The cart in which the officer lay was turned into the Rostóvs&rsquo; yard, and dozens of carts with wounded men began at the invitation of the townsfolk to turn into the yards and to draw up at the entrances of the houses in Povarskáya Street. Natásha was evidently pleased to be dealing with new people outside the ordinary routine of her life. She and Mávra Kuzmínichna tried to get as many of the wounded as possible into their yard.</p>",
  "page-1032": "<p>&ldquo;Your Papa must be told, though,&rdquo; said Mávra Kuzmínichna.</p><p>&ldquo;Never mind, never mind, what does it matter? For one day we can move into the drawing room. They can have all our half of the house.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There now, young lady, you do take things into your head! Even if we put them into the wing, the men&rsquo;s room, or the nurse&rsquo;s room, we must ask permission.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll ask.&rdquo;</p><p>Natásha ran into the house and went on tiptoe through the half-open door into the sitting room, where there was a smell of vinegar and Hoffman&rsquo;s drops.</p>",
  "page-1033": "<p>&ldquo;Are you asleep, Mamma?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, what sleep&mdash;?&rdquo; said the countess, waking up just as she was dropping into a doze.</p><p>&ldquo;Mamma darling!&rdquo; said Natásha, kneeling by her mother and bringing her face close to her mother&rsquo;s, &ldquo;I am sorry, forgive me, I&rsquo;ll never do it again; I woke you up! Mávra Kuzmínichna has sent me: they have brought some wounded here&mdash;officers. Will you let them come? They have nowhere to go. I knew you&rsquo;d let them come!&rdquo; she said quickly all in one breath.</p><p>&ldquo;What officers? Whom have they brought? I don&rsquo;t understand anything about it,&rdquo; said the countess.</p>",
  "page-1034": "<p>Natásha laughed, and the countess too smiled slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d give permission... so I&rsquo;ll tell them,&rdquo; and, having kissed her mother, Natásha got up and went to the door.</p><p>In the hall she met her father, who had returned with bad news.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve stayed too long!&rdquo; said the count with involuntary vexation. &ldquo;The Club is closed and the police are leaving.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Papa, is it all right&mdash;I&rsquo;ve invited some of the wounded into the house?&rdquo; said Natásha.</p>",
  "page-1035": "<p>&ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; he answered absently. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the point. I beg you not to indulge in trifles now, but to help to pack, and tomorrow we must go, go, go!...&rdquo;</p><p>And the count gave a similar order to the major-domo and the servants.</p><p>At dinner Pétya having returned home told them the news he had heard. He said the people had been getting arms in the Krémlin, and that though Rostopchín&rsquo;s broadsheet had said that he would sound a call two or three days in advance, the order had certainly already been given for everyone to go armed to the Three Hills tomorrow, and that there would be a big battle there.</p>",
  "page-1036": "<p>The countess looked with timid horror at her son&rsquo;s eager, excited face as he said this. She realized that if she said a word about his not going to the battle (she knew he enjoyed the thought of the impending engagement) he would say something about men, honor, and the fatherland&mdash;something senseless, masculine, and obstinate which there would be no contradicting, and her plans would be spoiled; and so, hoping to arrange to leave before then and take Pétya with her as their protector and defender, she did not answer him, but after dinner called the count aside and implored him with tears to take her away quickly, that very night if possible. With a woman&rsquo;s involuntary loving cunning she, who till then had not shown any alarm, said that she would die of fright if they did not leave that very night. Without any pretense she was now afraid of everything.</p>",
  "page-1037": "<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>",
  "page-1038": "<p>Madame Schoss, who had been out to visit her daughter, increased the countess&rsquo; fears still more by telling what she had seen at a spirit dealer&rsquo;s in Myasnítski Street. When returning by that street she had been unable to pass because of a drunken crowd rioting in front of the shop. She had taken a cab and driven home by a side street and the cabman had told her that the people were breaking open the barrels at the drink store, having received orders to do so.</p><p>After dinner the whole Rostóv household set to work with enthusiastic haste packing their belongings and preparing for their departure. The old count, suddenly setting to work, kept passing from the yard to the house and back again, shouting confused instructions to the hurrying people, and flurrying them still more. Pétya directed things in the yard.</p>",
  "page-1039": "<p> Sónya, owing to the count&rsquo;s contradictory orders, lost her head and did not know what to do. The servants ran noisily about the house and yard, shouting and disputing. Natásha, with the ardor characteristic of all she did suddenly set to work too. At first her intervention in the business of packing was received skeptically. Everybody expected some prank from her and did not wish to obey her; but she resolutely and passionately demanded obedience, grew angry and nearly cried because they did not heed her, and at last succeeded in making them believe her. Her first exploit, which cost her immense effort and established her authority, was the packing of the carpets. The count had valuable Gobelin tapestries and Persian carpets in the house. When Natásha set to work two cases were standing open in the ballroom, one almost full up with crockery, the other with carpets.</p>",
  "page-1040": "<p> There was also much china standing on the tables, and still more was being brought in from the storeroom. A third case was needed and servants had gone to fetch it.</p><p>&ldquo;Sónya, wait a bit&mdash;we&rsquo;ll pack everything into these,&rdquo; said Natásha.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t, Miss, we have tried to,&rdquo; said the butler&rsquo;s assistant.</p><p>&ldquo;No, wait a minute, please.&rdquo;</p><p>And Natásha began rapidly taking out of the case dishes and plates wrapped in paper.</p><p>&ldquo;The dishes must go in here among the carpets,&rdquo; said she.</p>",
  "page-1041": "<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a mercy if we can get the carpets alone into three cases,&rdquo; said the butler&rsquo;s assistant.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, wait, please!&rdquo; And Natásha began rapidly and deftly sorting out the things. &ldquo;These aren&rsquo;t needed,&rdquo; said she, putting aside some plates of Kiev ware. &ldquo;These&mdash;yes, these must go among the carpets,&rdquo; she said, referring to the Saxony china dishes.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Natásha! Leave it alone! We&rsquo;ll get it all packed,&rdquo; urged Sónya reproachfully.</p><p>&ldquo;What a young lady she is!&rdquo; remarked the major-domo.</p>",
  "page-1042": "<p>But Natásha would not give in. She turned everything out and began quickly repacking, deciding that the inferior Russian carpets and unnecessary crockery should not be taken at all. When everything had been taken out of the cases, they recommenced packing, and it turned out that when the cheaper things not worth taking had nearly all been rejected, the valuable ones really did all go into the two cases. Only the lid of the case containing the carpets would not shut down. A few more things might have been taken out, but Natásha insisted on having her own way. She packed, repacked, pressed, made the butler&rsquo;s assistant and Pétya&mdash;whom she had drawn into the business of packing&mdash;press on the lid, and made desperate efforts herself.</p>",
  "page-1043": "<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, Natásha,&rdquo; said Sónya. &ldquo;I see you were right, but just take out the top one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Natásha, with one hand holding back the hair that hung over her perspiring face, while with the other she pressed down the carpets. &ldquo;Now press, Pétya! Press, Vasílich, press hard!&rdquo; she cried.</p><p>The carpets yielded and the lid closed; Natásha, clapping her hands, screamed with delight and tears fell from her eyes. But this only lasted a moment. She at once set to work afresh and they now trusted her completely. The count was not angry even when they told him that Natásha had countermanded an order of his, and the servants now came to her to ask whether a cart was sufficiently loaded, and whether it might be corded up.</p>",
  "page-1044": "<p> Thanks to Natásha&rsquo;s directions the work now went on expeditiously, unnecessary things were left, and the most valuable packed as compactly as possible.</p><p>But hard as they all worked till quite late that night, they could not get everything packed. The countess had fallen asleep and the count, having put off their departure till next morning, went to bed.</p><p>Sónya and Natásha slept in the sitting room without undressing.</p><p>That night another wounded man was driven down the Povarskáya, and Mávra Kuzmínichna, who was standing at the gate, had him brought into the Rostóvs&rsquo; yard. Mávra Kuzmínichna concluded that he was a very important man. He was being conveyed in a calèche with a raised hood, and was quite covered by an apron. On the box beside the driver sat a venerable old attendant. A doctor and two soldiers followed the carriage in a cart.</p>",
  "page-1045": "<p>&ldquo;Please come in here. The masters are going away and the whole house will be empty,&rdquo; said the old woman to the old attendant.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps,&rdquo; said he with a sigh. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t expect to get him home alive! We have a house of our own in Moscow, but it&rsquo;s a long way from here, and there&rsquo;s nobody living in it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do us the honor to come in, there&rsquo;s plenty of everything in the master&rsquo;s house. Come in,&rdquo; said Mávra Kuzmínichna. &ldquo;Is he very ill?&rdquo; she asked.</p>",
  "page-1046": "<p>The attendant made a hopeless gesture.</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t expect to get him home! We must ask the doctor.&rdquo;</p><p>And the old servant got down from the box and went up to the cart.</p><p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; said the doctor.</p><p>The old servant returned to the calèche, looked into it, shook his head disconsolately, told the driver to turn into the yard, and stopped beside Mávra Kuzmínichna.</p><p>&ldquo;O, Lord Jesus Christ!&rdquo; she murmured.</p><p>She invited them to take the wounded man into the house.</p>",
  "page-1047": "<p>&ldquo;The masters won&rsquo;t object...&rdquo; she said.</p><p>But they had to avoid carrying the man upstairs, and so they took him into the wing and put him in the room that had been Madame Schoss&rsquo;.</p><p>This wounded man was Prince Andrew Bolkónski.</p>",
  "page-1048": "<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>",
  "page-1049": "<p>Moscow&rsquo;s last day had come. It was a clear bright autumn day, a Sunday. The church bells everywhere were ringing for service, just as usual on Sundays. Nobody seemed yet to realize what awaited the city.</p><p>Only two things indicated the social condition of Moscow&mdash;the rabble, that is the poor people, and the price of commodities. An enormous crowd of factory hands, house serfs, and peasants, with whom some officials, seminarists, and gentry were mingled, had gone early that morning to the Three Hills. Having waited there for Rostopchín who did not turn up, they became convinced that Moscow would be surrendered, and then dispersed all about the town to the public houses and cookshops. Prices too that day indicated the state of affairs.</p>",
  "page-1050": "<p> The price of weapons, of gold, of carts and horses, kept rising, but the value of paper money and city articles kept falling, so that by midday there were instances of carters removing valuable goods, such as cloth, and receiving in payment a half of what they carted, while peasant horses were fetching five hundred rubles each, and furniture, mirrors, and bronzes were being given away for nothing.</p><p>In the Rostóvs&rsquo; staid old-fashioned house the dissolution of former conditions of life was but little noticeable. As to the serfs the only indication was that three out of their huge retinue disappeared during the night, but nothing was stolen; and as to the value of their possessions, the thirty peasant carts that had come in from their estates and which many people envied proved to be extremely valuable and they were offered enormous sums of money for them.</p>",
  "page-1051": "<p> Not only were huge sums offered for the horses and carts, but on the previous evening and early in the morning of the first of September, orderlies and servants sent by wounded officers came to the Rostóvs&rsquo; and wounded men dragged themselves there from the Rostóvs&rsquo; and from neighboring houses where they were accommodated, entreating the servants to try to get them a lift out of Moscow. The major-domo to whom these entreaties were addressed, though he was sorry for the wounded, resolutely refused, saying that he dare not even mention the matter to the count. Pity these wounded men as one might, it was evident that if they were given one cart there would be no reason to refuse another, or all the carts and one&rsquo;s own carriages as well. Thirty carts could not save all the wounded and in the general catastrophe one could not disregard oneself and one&rsquo;s own family. So thought the major-domo on his master&rsquo;s behalf.</p>",
  "page-1052": "<p>On waking up that morning Count Ilyá Rostóv left his bedroom softly, so as not to wake the countess who had fallen asleep only toward morning, and came out to the porch in his lilac silk dressing gown. In the yard stood the carts ready corded. The carriages were at the front porch. The major-domo stood at the porch talking to an elderly orderly and to a pale young officer with a bandaged arm. On seeing the count the major-domo made a significant and stern gesture to them both to go away.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, Vasílich, is everything ready?&rdquo; asked the count, and stroking his bald head he looked good-naturedly at the officer and the orderly and nodded to them. (He liked to see new faces.)</p>",
  "page-1053": "<p>&ldquo;We can harness at once, your excellency.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s right. As soon as the countess wakes we&rsquo;ll be off, God willing! What is it, gentlemen?&rdquo; he added, turning to the officer. &ldquo;Are you staying in my house?&rdquo;</p><p>The officer came nearer and suddenly his face flushed crimson.</p><p>&ldquo;Count, be so good as to allow me... for God&rsquo;s sake, to get into some corner of one of your carts! I have nothing here with me.... I shall be all right on a loaded cart....&rdquo;</p><p>Before the officer had finished speaking the orderly made the same request on behalf of his master.</p>",
  "page-1054": "<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, yes, yes!&rdquo; said the count hastily. &ldquo;I shall be very pleased, very pleased. Vasílich, you&rsquo;ll see to it. Just unload one or two carts. Well, what of it... do what&rsquo;s necessary...&rdquo; said the count, muttering some indefinite order.</p><p>But at the same moment an expression of warm gratitude on the officer&rsquo;s face had already sealed the order. The count looked around him. In the yard, at the gates, at the window of the wings, wounded officers and their orderlies were to be seen. They were all looking at the count and moving toward the porch.</p><p>&ldquo;Please step into the gallery, your excellency,&rdquo; said the major-domo. &ldquo;What are your orders about the pictures?&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1055": "<p>The count went into the house with him, repeating his order not to refuse the wounded who asked for a lift.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, never mind, some of the things can be unloaded,&rdquo; he added in a soft, confidential voice, as though afraid of being overheard.</p><p>At nine o&rsquo;clock the countess woke up, and Matrëna Timoféevna, who had been her lady&rsquo;s maid before her marriage and now performed a sort of chief gendarme&rsquo;s duty for her, came to say that Madame Schoss was much offended and the young ladies&rsquo; summer dresses could not be left behind. On inquiry, the countess learned that Madame Schoss was offended because her trunk had been taken down from its cart, and all the loads were being uncorded and the luggage taken out of the carts to make room for wounded men whom the count in the simplicity of his heart had ordered that they should take with them. The countess sent for her husband.</p>",
  "page-1056": "<p>&ldquo;What is this, my dear? I hear that the luggage is being unloaded.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know, love, I wanted to tell you... Countess dear... an officer came to me to ask for a few carts for the wounded. After all, ours are things that can be bought but think what being left behind means to them!... Really now, in our own yard&mdash;we asked them in ourselves and there are officers among them.... You know, I think, my dear... let them be taken... where&rsquo;s the hurry?&rdquo;</p><p>The count spoke timidly, as he always did when talking of money matters. The countess was accustomed to this tone as a precursor of news of something detrimental to the children&rsquo;s interests, such as the building of a new gallery or conservatory, the inauguration of a private theater or an orchestra.</p>",
  "page-1057": "<p> She was accustomed always to oppose anything announced in that timid tone and considered it her duty to do so.</p><p>She assumed her dolefully submissive manner and said to her husband: &ldquo;Listen to me, Count, you have managed matters so that we are getting nothing for the house, and now you wish to throw away all our&mdash;all the children&rsquo;s property! You said yourself that we have a hundred thousand rubles&rsquo; worth of things in the house. I don&rsquo;t consent, my dear, I don&rsquo;t! Do as you please! It&rsquo;s the government&rsquo;s business to look after the wounded; they know that. Look at the Lopukhíns opposite, they cleared out everything two days ago. That&rsquo;s what other people do. It&rsquo;s only we who are such fools. If you have no pity on me, have some for the children.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1058": "<p>Flourishing his arms in despair the count left the room without replying.</p><p>&ldquo;Papa, what are you doing that for?&rdquo; asked Natásha, who had followed him into her mother&rsquo;s room.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing! What business is it of yours?&rdquo; muttered the count angrily.</p><p>&ldquo;But I heard,&rdquo; said Natásha. &ldquo;Why does Mamma object?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What business is it of yours?&rdquo; cried the count.</p><p>Natásha stepped up to the window and pondered.</p><p>&ldquo;Papa! Here&rsquo;s Berg coming to see us,&rdquo; said she, looking out of the window.</p>",
  "page-1059": "<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>",
  "page-1060": "<p>Berg, the Rostóvs&rsquo; son-in-law, was already a colonel wearing the orders of Vladímir and Anna, and he still filled the quiet and agreeable post of assistant to the head of the staff of the assistant commander of the first division of the Second Army.</p><p>On the first of September he had come to Moscow from the army.</p><p>He had nothing to do in Moscow, but he had noticed that everyone in the army was asking for leave to visit Moscow and had something to do there. So he considered it necessary to ask for leave of absence for family and domestic reasons.</p><p>Berg drove up to his father-in-law&rsquo;s house in his spruce little trap with a pair of sleek roans, exactly like those of a certain prince. He looked attentively at the carts in the yard and while going up to the porch took out a clean pocket handkerchief and tied a knot in it.</p>",
  "page-1061": "<p>From the anteroom Berg ran with smooth though impatient steps into the drawing room, where he embraced the count, kissed the hands of Natásha and Sónya, and hastened to inquire after &ldquo;Mamma&rsquo;s&rdquo; health.</p><p>&ldquo;Health, at a time like this?&rdquo; said the count. &ldquo;Come, tell us the news! Is the army retreating or will there be another battle?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God Almighty alone can decide the fate of our fatherland, Papa,&rdquo; said Berg. &ldquo;The army is burning with a spirit of heroism and the leaders, so to say, have now assembled in council. No one knows what is coming. But in general I can tell you, Papa, that such a heroic spirit, the truly antique valor of the Russian army, which they&mdash;which it&rdquo; (he corrected himself) &ldquo;has shown or displayed in the battle of the twenty-sixth&mdash;</p>",
  "page-1062": "<p>there are no words worthy to do it justice! I tell you, Papa&rdquo; (he smote himself on the breast as a general he had heard speaking had done, but Berg did it a trifle late for he should have struck his breast at the words &ldquo;Russian army&rdquo;), &ldquo;I tell you frankly that we, the commanders, far from having to urge the men on or anything of that kind, could hardly restrain those... those... yes, those exploits of antique valor,&rdquo; he went on rapidly. &ldquo;General Barclay de Tolly risked his life everywhere at the head of the troops, I can assure you. Our corps was stationed on a hillside. You can imagine!&rdquo;</p><p>And Berg related all that he remembered of the various tales he had heard those days. Natásha watched him with an intent gaze that confused him, as if she were trying to find in his face the answer to some question.</p>",
  "page-1063": "<p>&ldquo;Altogether such heroism as was displayed by the Russian warriors cannot be imagined or adequately praised!&rdquo; said Berg, glancing round at Natásha, and as if anxious to conciliate her, replying to her intent look with a smile. &ldquo;&lsquo;Russia is not in Moscow, she lives in the hearts of her sons!&rsquo; Isn&rsquo;t it so, Papa?&rdquo; said he.</p><p>Just then the countess came in from the sitting room with a weary and dissatisfied expression. Berg hurriedly jumped up, kissed her hand, asked about her health, and, swaying his head from side to side to express sympathy, remained standing beside her.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Mamma, I tell you sincerely that these are hard and sad times for every Russian. But why are you so anxious? You have still time to get away....&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1064": "<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think what the servants are about,&rdquo; said the countess, turning to her husband. &ldquo;I have just been told that nothing is ready yet. Somebody after all must see to things. One misses Mítenka at such times. There won&rsquo;t be any end to it.&rdquo;</p><p>The count was about to say something, but evidently restrained himself. He got up from his chair and went to the door.</p><p>At that moment Berg drew out his handkerchief as if to blow his nose and, seeing the knot in it, pondered, shaking his head sadly and significantly.</p><p>&ldquo;And I have a great favor to ask of you, Papa,&rdquo; said he.</p>",
  "page-1065": "<p>&ldquo;Hm...&rdquo; said the count, and stopped.</p><p>&ldquo;I was driving past Yusúpov&rsquo;s house just now,&rdquo; said Berg with a laugh, &ldquo;when the steward, a man I know, ran out and asked me whether I wouldn&rsquo;t buy something. I went in out of curiosity, you know, and there is a small chiffonier and a dressing table. You know how dear Véra wanted a chiffonier like that and how we had a dispute about it.&rdquo; (At the mention of the chiffonier and dressing table Berg involuntarily changed his tone to one of pleasure at his admirable domestic arrangements.) &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s such a beauty! It pulls out and has a secret English drawer, you know! And dear Véra has long wanted one. I wish to give her a surprise, you see. I saw so many of those peasant carts in your yard. Please let me have one, I will pay the man well, and...&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1066": "<p>The count frowned and coughed.</p><p>&ldquo;Ask the countess, I don&rsquo;t give orders.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s inconvenient, please don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Berg. &ldquo;Only I so wanted it, for dear Véra&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, go to the devil, all of you! To the devil, the devil, the devil...&rdquo; cried the old count. &ldquo;My head&rsquo;s in a whirl!&rdquo;</p><p>And he left the room. The countess began to cry.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Mamma! Yes, these are very hard times!&rdquo; said Berg.</p>",
  "page-1067": "<p>Natásha left the room with her father and, as if finding it difficult to reach some decision, first followed him and then ran downstairs.</p><p>Pétya was in the porch, engaged in giving out weapons to the servants who were to leave Moscow. The loaded carts were still standing in the yard. Two of them had been uncorded and a wounded officer was climbing into one of them helped by an orderly.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know what it&rsquo;s about?&rdquo; Pétya asked Natásha.</p><p>She understood that he meant what were their parents quarreling about. She did not answer.</p>",
  "page-1068": "<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because Papa wanted to give up all the carts to the wounded,&rdquo; said Pétya. &ldquo;Vasílich told me. I consider...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I consider,&rdquo; Natásha suddenly almost shouted, turning her angry face to Pétya, &ldquo;I consider it so horrid, so abominable, so... I don&rsquo;t know what. Are we despicable Germans?&rdquo;</p><p>Her throat quivered with convulsive sobs and, afraid of weakening and letting the force of her anger run to waste, she turned and rushed headlong up the stairs.</p><p>Berg was sitting beside the countess consoling her with the respectful attention of a relative. The count, pipe in hand, was pacing up and down the room, when Natásha, her face distorted by anger, burst in like a tempest and approached her mother with rapid steps.</p>",
  "page-1069": "<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s horrid! It&rsquo;s abominable!&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t possibly have ordered it!&rdquo;</p><p>Berg and the countess looked at her, perplexed and frightened. The count stood still at the window and listened.</p><p>&ldquo;Mamma, it&rsquo;s impossible: see what is going on in the yard!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;They will be left!...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you? Who are &lsquo;they&rsquo;? What do you want?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, the wounded! It&rsquo;s impossible, Mamma. It&rsquo;s monstrous!... No, Mamma darling, it&rsquo;s not the thing. Please forgive me, darling.... Mamma, what does it matter what we take away? Only look what is going on in the yard... Mamma!... It&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1070": "<p>The count stood by the window and listened without turning round. Suddenly he sniffed and put his face closer to the window.</p><p>The countess glanced at her daughter, saw her face full of shame for her mother, saw her agitation, and understood why her husband did not turn to look at her now, and she glanced round quite disconcerted.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, do as you like! Am I hindering anyone?&rdquo; she said, not surrendering at once.</p><p>&ldquo;Mamma, darling, forgive me!&rdquo;</p><p>But the countess pushed her daughter away and went up to her husband.</p><p>&ldquo;My dear, you order what is right.... You know I don&rsquo;t understand about it,&rdquo; said she, dropping her eyes shamefacedly.</p>",
  "page-1071": "<p>&ldquo;The eggs... the eggs are teaching the hen,&rdquo; muttered the count through tears of joy, and he embraced his wife who was glad to hide her look of shame on his breast.</p><p>&ldquo;Papa! Mamma! May I see to it? May I?...&rdquo; asked Natásha. &ldquo;We will still take all the most necessary things.&rdquo;</p><p>The count nodded affirmatively, and Natásha, at the rapid pace at which she used to run when playing at tag, ran through the ballroom to the anteroom and downstairs into the yard.</p><p>The servants gathered round Natásha, but could not believe the strange order she brought them until the count himself, in his wife&rsquo;s name, confirmed the order to give up all the carts to the wounded and take the trunks to the storerooms. When they understood that order the servants set to work at this new task with pleasure and zeal.</p>",
  "page-1072": "<p> It no longer seemed strange to them but on the contrary it seemed the only thing that could be done, just as a quarter of an hour before it had not seemed strange to anyone that the wounded should be left behind and the goods carted away but that had seemed the only thing to do.</p><p>The whole household, as if to atone for not having done it sooner, set eagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the carts. The wounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood with pale but happy faces round the carts. The news that carts were to be had spread to the neighboring houses, from which wounded men began to come into the Rostóvs&rsquo; yard. Many of the wounded asked them not to unload the carts but only to let them sit on the top of the things. But the work of unloading, once started, could not be arrested.</p>",
  "page-1073": "<p> It seemed not to matter whether all or only half the things were left behind. Cases full of china, bronzes, pictures, and mirrors that had been so carefully packed the night before now lay about the yard, and still they went on searching for and finding possibilities of unloading this or that and letting the wounded have another and yet another cart.</p><p>&ldquo;We can take four more men,&rdquo; said the steward. &ldquo;They can have my trap, or else what is to become of them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let them have my wardrobe cart,&rdquo; said the countess. &ldquo;Dunyásha can go with me in the carriage.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1074": "<p>They unloaded the wardrobe cart and sent it to take wounded men from a house two doors off. The whole household, servants included, was bright and animated. Natásha was in a state of rapturous excitement such as she had not known for a long time.</p><p>&ldquo;What could we fasten this onto?&rdquo; asked the servants, trying to fix a trunk on the narrow footboard behind a carriage. &ldquo;We must keep at least one cart.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in it?&rdquo; asked Natásha.</p><p>&ldquo;The count&rsquo;s books.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Leave it, Vasílich will put it away. It&rsquo;s not wanted.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1075": "<p>The phaeton was full of people and there was a doubt as to where Count Peter could sit.</p><p>&ldquo;On the box. You&rsquo;ll sit on the box, won&rsquo;t you, Pétya?&rdquo; cried Natásha.</p><p>Sónya too was busy all this time, but the aim of her efforts was quite different from Natásha&rsquo;s. She was putting away the things that had to be left behind and making a list of them as the countess wished, and she tried to get as much taken away with them as possible.</p>",
  "page-1076": "<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>",
  "page-1077": "<p>Before two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon the Rostóvs&rsquo; four carriages, packed full and with the horses harnessed, stood at the front door. One by one the carts with the wounded had moved out of the yard.</p><p>The calèche in which Prince Andrew was being taken attracted Sónya&rsquo;s attention as it passed the front porch. With the help of a maid she was arranging a seat for the countess in the huge high coach that stood at the entrance.</p><p>&ldquo;Whose calèche is that?&rdquo; she inquired, leaning out of the carriage window.</p><p>&ldquo;Why, didn&rsquo;t you know, Miss?&rdquo; replied the maid. &ldquo;The wounded prince: he spent the night in our house and is going with us.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1078": "<p>&ldquo;But who is it? What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our intended that was&mdash;Prince Bolkónski himself! They say he is dying,&rdquo; replied the maid with a sigh.</p><p>Sónya jumped out of the coach and ran to the countess. The countess, tired out and already dressed in shawl and bonnet for her journey, was pacing up and down the drawing room, waiting for the household to assemble for the usual silent prayer with closed doors before starting. Natásha was not in the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; said Sónya, &ldquo;Prince Andrew is here, mortally wounded. He is going with us.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1079": "<p>The countess opened her eyes in dismay and, seizing Sónya&rsquo;s arm, glanced around.</p><p>&ldquo;Natásha?&rdquo; she murmured.</p><p>At that moment this news had only one significance for both of them. They knew their Natásha, and alarm as to what would happen if she heard this news stifled all sympathy for the man they both liked.</p><p>&ldquo;Natásha does not know yet, but he is going with us,&rdquo; said Sónya.</p><p>&ldquo;You say he is dying?&rdquo;</p><p>Sónya nodded.</p><p>The countess put her arms around Sónya and began to cry.</p>",
  "page-1080": "<p>&ldquo;The ways of God are past finding out!&rdquo; she thought, feeling that the Almighty Hand, hitherto unseen, was becoming manifest in all that was now taking place.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, Mamma? Everything is ready. What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Natásha, as with animated face she ran into the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; answered the countess. &ldquo;If everything is ready let us start.&rdquo;</p><p>And the countess bent over her reticule to hide her agitated face. Sónya embraced Natásha and kissed her.</p><p>Natásha looked at her inquiringly.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it? What has happened?&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1081": "<p>&ldquo;Nothing... No...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it something very bad for me? What is it?&rdquo; persisted Natásha with her quick intuition.</p><p>Sónya sighed and made no reply. The count, Pétya, Madame Schoss, Mávra Kuzmínichna, and Vasílich came into the drawing room and, having closed the doors, they all sat down and remained for some moments silently seated without looking at one another.</p><p>The count was the first to rise, and with a loud sigh crossed himself before the icon. All the others did the same. Then the count embraced Mávra Kuzmínichna and Vasílich, who were to remain in Moscow, and while they caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he patted their backs lightly with some vaguely affectionate and comforting words. The countess went into the oratory and there Sónya found her on her knees before the icons that had been left here and there hanging on the wall. (The most precious ones, with which some family tradition was connected, were being taken with them.)</p>",
  "page-1082": "<p>In the porch and in the yard the men whom Pétya had armed with swords and daggers, with trousers tucked inside their high boots and with belts and girdles tightened, were taking leave of those remaining behind.</p><p>As is always the case at a departure, much had been forgotten or put in the wrong place, and for a long time two menservants stood one on each side of the open door and the carriage steps waiting to help the countess in, while maids rushed with cushions and bundles from the house to the carriages, the calèche, the phaeton, and back again.</p><p>&ldquo;They always will forget everything!&rdquo; said the countess. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know I can&rsquo;t sit like that?&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1083": "<p>And Dunyásha, with clenched teeth, without replying but with an aggrieved look on her face, hastily got into the coach to rearrange the seat.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, those servants!&rdquo; said the count, swaying his head.</p><p>Efím, the old coachman, who was the only one the countess trusted to drive her, sat perched up high on the box and did not so much as glance round at what was going on behind him. From thirty years&rsquo; experience he knew it would be some time yet before the order, &ldquo;Be off, in God&rsquo;s name!&rdquo; would be given him: and he knew that even when it was said he would be stopped once or twice more while they sent back to fetch something that had been forgotten, and even after that he would again be stopped and the countess herself would lean out of the window and beg him for the love of heaven to drive carefully down the hill.</p>",
  "page-1084": "<p> He knew all this and therefore waited calmly for what would happen, with more patience than the horses, especially the near one, the chestnut Falcon, who was pawing the ground and champing his bit. At last all were seated, the carriage steps were folded and pulled up, the door was shut, somebody was sent for a traveling case, and the countess leaned out and said what she had to say. Then Efím deliberately doffed his hat and began crossing himself. The postilion and all the other servants did the same. &ldquo;Off, in God&rsquo;s name!&rdquo; said Efím, putting on his hat. &ldquo;Start!&rdquo; The postilion started the horses, the off pole horse tugged at his collar, the high springs creaked, and the body of the coach swayed. The footman sprang onto the box of the moving coach which jolted as it passed out of the yard onto the uneven roadway;</p>",
  "page-1085": "<p> the other vehicles jolted in their turn, and the procession of carriages moved up the street. In the carriages, the calèche, and the phaeton, all crossed themselves as they passed the church opposite the house. Those who were to remain in Moscow walked on either side of the vehicles seeing the travelers off.</p><p>Rarely had Natásha experienced so joyful a feeling as now, sitting in the carriage beside the countess and gazing at the slowly receding walls of forsaken, agitated Moscow. Occasionally she leaned out of the carriage window and looked back and then forward at the long train of wounded in front of them. Almost at the head of the line she could see the raised hood of Prince Andrew&rsquo;s calèche. She did not know who was in it, but each time she looked at the procession her eyes sought that calèche. She knew it was right in front.</p>",
  "page-1086": "<p>In Kúdrino, from the Nikítski, Présnya, and Podnovínsk Streets came several other trains of vehicles similar to the Rostóvs&rsquo;, and as they passed along the Sadóvaya Street the carriages and carts formed two rows abreast.</p><p>As they were going round the Súkharev water tower Natásha, who was inquisitively and alertly scrutinizing the people driving or walking past, suddenly cried out in joyful surprise:</p><p>&ldquo;Dear me! Mamma, Sónya, look, it&rsquo;s he!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who? Who?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look! Yes, on my word, it&rsquo;s Bezúkhov!&rdquo; said Natásha, putting her head out of the carriage and staring at a tall, stout man in a coachman&rsquo;s long coat, who from his manner of walking and moving was evidently a gentleman in disguise, and who was passing under the arch of the Súkharev tower accompanied by a small, sallow-faced, beardless old man in a frieze coat.</p>",
  "page-1087": "<p>&ldquo;Yes, it really is Bezúkhov in a coachman&rsquo;s coat, with a queer-looking old boy. Really,&rdquo; said Natásha, &ldquo;look, look!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not he. How can you talk such nonsense?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; screamed Natásha, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stake my head it&rsquo;s he! I assure you! Stop, stop!&rdquo; she cried to the coachman.</p><p>But the coachman could not stop, for from the Meshchánski Street came more carts and carriages, and the Rostóvs were being shouted at to move on and not block the way.</p>",
  "page-1088": "<p>In fact, however, though now much farther off than before, the Rostóvs all saw Pierre&mdash;or someone extraordinarily like him&mdash;in a coachman&rsquo;s coat, going down the street with head bent and a serious face beside a small, beardless old man who looked like a footman. That old man noticed a face thrust out of the carriage window gazing at them, and respectfully touching Pierre&rsquo;s elbow said something to him and pointed to the carriage. Pierre, evidently engrossed in thought, could not at first understand him. At length when he had understood and looked in the direction the old man indicated, he recognized Natásha, and following his first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly toward the coach. But having taken a dozen steps he seemed to remember something and stopped.</p>",
  "page-1089": "<p>Natásha&rsquo;s face, leaning out of the window, beamed with quizzical kindliness.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter Kirílovich, come here! We have recognized you! This is wonderful!&rdquo; she cried, holding out her hand to him. &ldquo;What are you doing? Why are you like this?&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre took her outstretched hand and kissed it awkwardly as he walked along beside her while the coach still moved on.</p><p>&ldquo;What is the matter, Count?&rdquo; asked the countess in a surprised and commiserating tone.</p><p>&ldquo;What? What? Why? Don&rsquo;t ask me,&rdquo; said Pierre, and looked round at Natásha whose radiant, happy expression&mdash;of which he was conscious without looking at her&mdash;filled him with enchantment.</p>",
  "page-1090": "<p>&ldquo;Are you remaining in Moscow, then?&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre hesitated.</p><p>&ldquo;In Moscow?&rdquo; he said in a questioning tone. &ldquo;Yes, in Moscow. Good-by!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, if only I were a man! I&rsquo;d certainly stay with you. How splendid!&rdquo; said Natásha. &ldquo;Mamma, if you&rsquo;ll let me, I&rsquo;ll stay!&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre glanced absently at Natásha and was about to say something, but the countess interrupted him.</p><p>&ldquo;You were at the battle, we heard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I was,&rdquo; Pierre answered. &ldquo;There will be another battle tomorrow...&rdquo; he began, but Natásha interrupted him.</p>",
  "page-1091": "<p>&ldquo;But what is the matter with you, Count? You are not like yourself....&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t ask me, don&rsquo;t ask me! I don&rsquo;t know myself. Tomorrow... But no! Good-by, good-by!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an awful time!&rdquo; and dropping behind the carriage he stepped onto the pavement.</p><p>Natásha continued to lean out of the window for a long time, beaming at him with her kindly, slightly quizzical, happy smile.</p>",
  "page-1092": "<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>",
  "page-1093": "<p>For the last two days, ever since leaving home, Pierre had been living in the empty house of his deceased benefactor, Bazdéev. This is how it happened.</p><p>When he woke up on the morning after his return to Moscow and his interview with Count Rostopchín, he could not for some time make out where he was and what was expected of him. When he was informed that among others awaiting him in his reception room there was a Frenchman who had brought a letter from his wife, the Countess Hélène, he felt suddenly overcome by that sense of confusion and hopelessness to which he was apt to succumb. He felt that everything was now at an end, all was in confusion and crumbling to pieces, that nobody was right or wrong, the future held nothing, and there was no escape from this position.</p>",
  "page-1094": "<p> Smiling unnaturally and muttering to himself, he first sat down on the sofa in an attitude of despair, then rose, went to the door of the reception room and peeped through the crack, returned flourishing his arms, and took up a book. His major-domo came in a second time to say that the Frenchman who had brought the letter from the countess was very anxious to see him if only for a minute, and that someone from Bazdéev&rsquo;s widow had called to ask Pierre to take charge of her husband&rsquo;s books, as she herself was leaving for the country.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, in a minute; wait... or no! No, of course... go and say I will come directly,&rdquo; Pierre replied to the major-domo.</p>",
  "page-1095": "<p>But as soon as the man had left the room Pierre took up his hat which was lying on the table and went out of his study by the other door. There was no one in the passage. He went along the whole length of this passage to the stairs and, frowning and rubbing his forehead with both hands, went down as far as the first landing. The hall porter was standing at the front door. From the landing where Pierre stood there was a second staircase leading to the back entrance. He went down that staircase and out into the yard. No one had seen him. But there were some carriages waiting, and as soon as Pierre stepped out of the gate the coachmen and the yard porter noticed him and raised their caps to him. When he felt he was being looked at he behaved like an ostrich which hides its head in a bush in order not to be seen: he hung his head and quickening his pace went down the street.</p>",
  "page-1096": "<p>Of all the affairs awaiting Pierre that day the sorting of Joseph Bazdéev&rsquo;s books and papers appeared to him the most necessary.</p><p>He hired the first cab he met and told the driver to go to the Patriarch&rsquo;s Ponds, where the widow Bazdéev&rsquo;s house was.</p><p>Continually turning round to look at the rows of loaded carts that were making their way from all sides out of Moscow, and balancing his bulky body so as not to slip out of the ramshackle old vehicle, Pierre, experiencing the joyful feeling of a boy escaping from school, began to talk to his driver.</p>",
  "page-1097": "<p>The man told him that arms were being distributed today at the Krémlin and that tomorrow everyone would be sent out beyond the Three Hills gates and a great battle would be fought there.</p><p>Having reached the Patriarch&rsquo;s Ponds Pierre found the Bazdéevs&rsquo; house, where he had not been for a long time past. He went up to the gate. Gerásim, that sallow beardless old man Pierre had seen at Torzhók five years before with Joseph Bazdéev, came out in answer to his knock.</p><p>&ldquo;At home?&rdquo; asked Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;Owing to the present state of things Sophia Danílovna has gone to the Torzhók estate with the children, your excellency.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1098": "<p>&ldquo;I will come in all the same, I have to look through the books,&rdquo; said Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;Be so good as to step in. Makár Alexéevich, the brother of my late master&mdash;may the kingdom of heaven be his&mdash;has remained here, but he is in a weak state as you know,&rdquo; said the old servant.</p><p>Pierre knew that Makár Alexéevich was Joseph Bazdéev&rsquo;s half-insane brother and a hard drinker.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I know. Let us go in...&rdquo; said Pierre and entered the house.</p><p>A tall, bald-headed old man with a red nose, wearing a dressing gown and with galoshes on his bare feet, stood in the anteroom. On seeing Pierre he muttered something angrily and went away along the passage.</p>",
  "page-1099": "<p>&ldquo;He was a very clever man but has now grown quite feeble, as your honor sees,&rdquo; said Gerásim. &ldquo;Will you step into the study?&rdquo; Pierre nodded. &ldquo;As it was sealed up so it has remained, but Sophia Danílovna gave orders that if anyone should come from you they were to have the books.&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre went into that gloomy study which he had entered with such trepidation in his benefactor&rsquo;s lifetime. The room, dusty and untouched since the death of Joseph Bazdéev was now even gloomier.</p><p>Gerásim opened one of the shutters and left the room on tiptoe. Pierre went round the study, approached the cupboard in which the manuscripts were kept, and took out what had once been one of the most important, the holy of holies of the order. This was the authentic Scotch Acts with Bazdéev&rsquo;s notes and explanations.</p>",
  "page-1100": "<p> He sat down at the dusty writing table, and, having laid the manuscripts before him, opened them out, closed them, finally pushed them away, and resting his head on his hand sank into meditation.</p><p>Gerásim looked cautiously into the study several times and saw Pierre always sitting in the same attitude.</p><p>More than two hours passed and Gerásim took the liberty of making a slight noise at the door to attract his attention, but Pierre did not hear him.</p><p>&ldquo;Is the cabman to be discharged, your honor?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; said Pierre, rousing himself and rising hurriedly. &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he added, taking Gerásim by a button of his coat and looking down at the old man with moist, shining, and ecstatic eyes, &ldquo;I say, do you know that there is going to be a battle tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1101": "<p>&ldquo;We heard so,&rdquo; replied the man.</p><p>&ldquo;I beg you not to tell anyone who I am, and to do what I ask you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, your excellency,&rdquo; replied Gerásim. &ldquo;Will you have something to eat?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, but I want something else. I want peasant clothes and a pistol,&rdquo; said Pierre, unexpectedly blushing.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, your excellency,&rdquo; said Gerásim after thinking for a moment.</p><p>All the rest of that day Pierre spent alone in his benefactor&rsquo;s study, and Gerásim heard him pacing restlessly from one corner to another and talking to himself. And he spent the night on a bed made up for him there.</p>",
  "page-1102": "<p>Gerásim, being a servant who in his time had seen many strange things, accepted Pierre&rsquo;s taking up his residence in the house without surprise, and seemed pleased to have someone to wait on. That same evening&mdash;without even asking himself what they were wanted for&mdash;he procured a coachman&rsquo;s coat and cap for Pierre, and promised to get him the pistol next day. Makár Alexéevich came twice that evening shuffling along in his galoshes as far as the door and stopped and looked ingratiatingly at Pierre. But as soon as Pierre turned toward him he wrapped his dressing gown around him with a shamefaced and angry look and hurried away. It was when Pierre (wearing the coachman&rsquo;s coat which Gerásim had procured for him and had disinfected by steam) was on his way with the old man to buy the pistol at the Súkharev market that he met the Rostóvs.</p>",

  "page-1104": "<p>Kutúzov&rsquo;s order to retreat through Moscow to the Ryazán road was issued at night on the first of September.</p><p>The first troops started at once, and during the night they marched slowly and steadily without hurry. At daybreak, however, those nearing the town at the Dorogomílov bridge saw ahead of them masses of soldiers crowding and hurrying across the bridge, ascending on the opposite side and blocking the streets and alleys, while endless masses of troops were bearing down on them from behind, and an unreasoning hurry and alarm overcame them. They all rushed forward to the bridge, onto it, and to the fords and the boats. Kutúzov himself had driven round by side streets to the other side of Moscow.</p>",
  "page-1105": "<p>By ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning of the second of September, only the rear guard remained in the Dorogomílov suburb, where they had ample room. The main army was on the other side of Moscow or beyond it.</p><p>At that very time, at ten in the morning of the second of September, Napoleon was standing among his troops on the Poklónny Hill looking at the panorama spread out before him. From the twenty-sixth of August to the second of September, that is from the battle of Borodinó to the entry of the French into Moscow, during the whole of that agitating, memorable week, there had been the extraordinary autumn weather that always comes as a surprise, when the sun hangs low and gives more heat than in spring, when everything shines so brightly in the rare clear atmosphere that the eyes smart, when the lungs are strengthened and refreshed by inhaling</p>",
  "page-1106": "<p>the aromatic autumn air, when even the nights are warm, and when in those dark warm nights, golden stars startle and delight us continually by falling from the sky.</p><p>At ten in the morning of the second of September this weather still held.</p><p>The brightness of the morning was magical. Moscow seen from the Poklónny Hill lay spaciously spread out with her river, her gardens, and her churches, and she seemed to be living her usual life, her cupolas glittering like stars in the sunlight.</p><p>The view of the strange city with its peculiar architecture, such as he had never seen before, filled Napoleon with the rather envious and uneasy curiosity men feel when they see an alien form of life that has no knowledge of them. This city was evidently living with the full force of its own life.</p>",
  "page-1107": "<p> By the indefinite signs which, even at a distance, distinguish a living body from a dead one, Napoleon from the Poklónny Hill perceived the throb of life in the town and felt, as it were, the breathing of that great and beautiful body.</p><p>Every Russian looking at Moscow feels her to be a mother; every foreigner who sees her, even if ignorant of her significance as the mother city, must feel her feminine character, and Napoleon felt it.</p><p>&ldquo;Cette ville asiatique aux innombrables églises, Moscou la sainte. La voilà donc enfin, cette fameuse ville! Il était temps,&rdquo; * said he, and dismounting he ordered a plan of Moscow to be spread out before him, and summoned Lelorgne d&rsquo;Ideville, the interpreter.</p>",
  "page-1108": "<p>&ldquo;A town captured by the enemy is like a maid who has lost her honor,&rdquo; thought he (he had said so to Túchkov at Smolénsk). From that point of view he gazed at the Oriental beauty he had not seen before. It seemed strange to him that his long-felt wish, which had seemed unattainable, had at last been realized. In the clear morning light he gazed now at the city and now at the plan, considering its details, and the assurance of possessing it agitated and awed him.</p><p>&ldquo;But could it be otherwise?&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Here is this capital at my feet. Where is Alexander now, and of what is he thinking? A strange, beautiful, and majestic city; and a strange and majestic moment! In what light must I appear to them!&rdquo; thought he, thinking of his troops.</p>",
  "page-1109": "<p> &ldquo;Here she is, the reward for all those fainthearted men,&rdquo; he reflected, glancing at those near him and at the troops who were approaching and forming up. &ldquo;One word from me, one movement of my hand, and that ancient capital of the Tsars would perish. But my clemency is always ready to descend upon the vanquished. I must be magnanimous and truly great. But no, it can&rsquo;t be true that I am in Moscow,&rdquo; he suddenly thought. &ldquo;Yet here she is lying at my feet, with her golden domes and crosses scintillating and twinkling in the sunshine. But I shall spare her. On the ancient monuments of barbarism and despotism I will inscribe great words of justice and mercy.... It is just this which Alexander will feel most painfully, I know him.&rdquo; (It seemed to Napoleon that the chief import of what was taking place lay in the personal struggle between himself and Alexander.)</p>",
  "page-1110": "<p> &ldquo;From the height of the Krémlin&mdash;yes, there is the Krémlin, yes&mdash;I will give them just laws; I will teach them the meaning of true civilization, I will make generations of boyars remember their conqueror with love. I will tell the deputation that I did not, and do not, desire war, that I have waged war only against the false policy of their court; that I love and respect Alexander and that in Moscow I will accept terms of peace worthy of myself and of my people. I do not wish to utilize the fortunes of war to humiliate an honored monarch. &lsquo;Boyars,&rsquo; I will say to them, &lsquo;I do not desire war, I desire the peace and welfare of all my subjects.&rsquo; However, I know their presence will inspire me, and I shall speak to them as I always do: clearly, impressively, and majestically. But can it be true that I am in Moscow? Yes, there she lies.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1111": "<p>&ldquo;Qu&rsquo;on m&rsquo;amène les boyars,&rdquo; * said he to his suite.</p><p>A general with a brilliant suite galloped off at once to fetch the boyars.</p><p>Two hours passed. Napoleon had lunched and was again standing in the same place on the Poklónny Hill awaiting the deputation. His speech to the boyars had already taken definite shape in his imagination. That speech was full of dignity and greatness as Napoleon understood it.</p><p>He was himself carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended to adopt toward Moscow. In his imagination he appointed days for assemblies at the palace of the Tsars, at which Russian notables and his own would mingle. He mentally appointed a governor, one who would win the hearts of the people. Having learned that there were many charitable institutions in Moscow he mentally decided that he would shower favors on them all.</p>",
  "page-1112": "<p> He thought that, as in Africa he had to put on a burnoose and sit in a mosque, so in Moscow he must be beneficent like the Tsars. And in order finally to touch the hearts of the Russians&mdash;and being like all Frenchmen unable to imagine anything sentimental without a reference to ma chère, ma tendre, ma pauvre mère * &mdash;he decided that he would place an inscription on all these establishments in large letters: &ldquo;This establishment is dedicated to my dear mother.&rdquo; Or no, it should be simply: Maison de ma Mère, *(2) he concluded. &ldquo;But am I really in Moscow? Yes, here it lies before me, but why is the deputation from the city so long in appearing?&rdquo; he wondered.</p><p>Meanwhile an agitated consultation was being carried on in whispers among his generals and marshals at the rear of his suite.</p>",
  "page-1113": "<p> Those sent to fetch the deputation had returned with the news that Moscow was empty, that everyone had left it. The faces of those who were not conferring together were pale and perturbed. They were not alarmed by the fact that Moscow had been abandoned by its inhabitants (grave as that fact seemed), but by the question how to tell the Emperor&mdash;without putting him in the terrible position of appearing ridiculous&mdash;that he had been awaiting the boyars so long in vain: that there were drunken mobs left in Moscow but no one else. Some said that a deputation of some sort must be scraped together, others disputed that opinion and maintained that the Emperor should first be carefully and skillfully prepared, and then told the truth.</p><p>&ldquo;He will have to be told, all the same,&rdquo; said some gentlemen of the suite. &ldquo;But, gentlemen...&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1114": "<p>The position was the more awkward because the Emperor, meditating upon his magnanimous plans, was pacing patiently up and down before the outspread map, occasionally glancing along the road to Moscow from under his lifted hand with a bright and proud smile.</p><p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s impossible...&rdquo; declared the gentlemen of the suite, shrugging their shoulders but not venturing to utter the implied word&mdash;le ridicule....</p><p>At last the Emperor, tired of futile expectation, his actor&rsquo;s instinct suggesting to him that the sublime moment having been too long drawn out was beginning to lose its sublimity, gave a sign with his hand. A single report of a signaling gun followed, and the troops, who were already spread out on different sides of Moscow, moved into the city through the Tver, Kalúga, and Dorogomílov gates.</p>",
  "page-1115": "<p> Faster and faster, vying with one another, they moved at the double or at a trot, vanishing amid the clouds of dust they raised and making the air ring with a deafening roar of mingling shouts.</p><p>Drawn on by the movement of his troops Napoleon rode with them as far as the Dorogomílov gate, but there again stopped and, dismounting from his horse, paced for a long time by the Kámmer-Kollézski rampart, awaiting the deputation.</p>",
  "page-1116": "<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>",
  "page-1117": "<p>Meanwhile Moscow was empty. There were still people in it, perhaps a fiftieth part of its former inhabitants had remained, but it was empty. It was empty in the sense that a dying queenless hive is empty.</p><p>In a queenless hive no life is left though to a superficial glance it seems as much alive as other hives.</p><p>The bees circle round a queenless hive in the hot beams of the midday sun as gaily as around the living hives; from a distance it smells of honey like the others, and bees fly in and out in the same way. But one has only to observe that hive to realize that there is no longer any life in it. The bees do not fly in the same way, the smell and the sound that meet the beekeeper are not the same.</p>",
  "page-1118": "<p> To the beekeeper&rsquo;s tap on the wall of the sick hive, instead of the former instant unanimous humming of tens of thousands of bees with their abdomens threateningly compressed, and producing by the rapid vibration of their wings an aerial living sound, the only reply is a disconnected buzzing from different parts of the deserted hive. From the alighting board, instead of the former spirituous fragrant smell of honey and venom, and the warm whiffs of crowded life, comes an odor of emptiness and decay mingling with the smell of honey. There are no longer sentinels sounding the alarm with their abdomens raised, and ready to die in defense of the hive. There is no longer the measured quiet sound of throbbing activity, like the sound of boiling water, but diverse discordant sounds of disorder. In and out of the hive long black robber bees smeared with honey fly timidly and shiftily.</p>",
  "page-1119": "<p> They do not sting, but crawl away from danger. Formerly only bees laden with honey flew into the hive, and they flew out empty; now they fly out laden. The beekeeper opens the lower part of the hive and peers in. Instead of black, glossy bees&mdash;tamed by toil, clinging to one another&rsquo;s legs and drawing out the wax, with a ceaseless hum of labor&mdash;that used to hang in long clusters down to the floor of the hive, drowsy shriveled bees crawl about separately in various directions on the floor and walls of the hive. Instead of a neatly glued floor, swept by the bees with the fanning of their wings, there is a floor littered with bits of wax, excrement, dying bees scarcely moving their legs, and dead ones that have not been cleared away.</p>",
  "page-1120": "<p>The beekeeper opens the upper part of the hive and examines the super. Instead of serried rows of bees sealing up every gap in the combs and keeping the brood warm, he sees the skillful complex structures of the combs, but no longer in their former state of purity. All is neglected and foul. Black robber bees are swiftly and stealthily prowling about the combs, and the short home bees, shriveled and listless as if they were old, creep slowly about without trying to hinder the robbers, having lost all motive and all sense of life. Drones, bumblebees, wasps, and butterflies knock awkwardly against the walls of the hive in their flight. Here and there among the cells containing dead brood and honey an angry buzzing can sometimes be heard. Here and there a couple of bees, by force of habit and custom cleaning out the brood cells, with efforts beyond their strength laboriously drag away a dead bee or bumblebee without knowing why they do it.</p>",
  "page-1121": "<p> In another corner two old bees are languidly fighting, or cleaning themselves, or feeding one another, without themselves knowing whether they do it with friendly or hostile intent. In a third place a crowd of bees, crushing one another, attack some victim and fight and smother it, and the victim, enfeebled or killed, drops from above slowly and lightly as a feather, among the heap of corpses. The keeper opens the two center partitions to examine the brood cells. In place of the former close dark circles formed by thousands of bees sitting back to back and guarding the high mystery of generation, he sees hundreds of dull, listless, and sleepy shells of bees. They have almost all died unawares, sitting in the sanctuary they had guarded and which is now no more. They reek of decay and death.</p>",
  "page-1122": "<p> Only a few of them still move, rise, and feebly fly to settle on the enemy&rsquo;s hand, lacking the spirit to die stinging him; the rest are dead and fall as lightly as fish scales. The beekeeper closes the hive, chalks a mark on it, and when he has time tears out its contents and burns it clean.</p><p>So in the same way Moscow was empty when Napoleon, weary, uneasy, and morose, paced up and down in front of the Kámmer-Kollézski rampart, awaiting what to his mind was a necessary, if but formal, observance of the proprieties&mdash;a deputation.</p><p>In various corners of Moscow there still remained a few people aimlessly moving about, following their old habits and hardly aware of what they were doing.</p>",
  "page-1123": "<p>When with due circumspection Napoleon was informed that Moscow was empty, he looked angrily at his informant, turned away, and silently continued to walk to and fro.</p><p>&ldquo;My carriage!&rdquo; he said.</p><p>He took his seat beside the aide-de-camp on duty and drove into the suburb. &ldquo;Moscow deserted!&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;What an incredible event!&rdquo;</p><p>He did not drive into the town, but put up at an inn in the Dorogomílov suburb.</p><p>The coup de théâtre had not come off.</p>",
  "page-1124": "<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>",
  "page-1125": "<p>The Russian troops were passing through Moscow from two o&rsquo;clock at night till two in the afternoon and bore away with them the wounded and the last of the inhabitants who were leaving.</p><p>The greatest crush during the movement of the troops took place at the Stone, Moskvá, and Yaúza bridges.</p><p>While the troops, dividing into two parts when passing around the Krémlin, were thronging the Moskvá and the Stone bridges, a great many soldiers, taking advantage of the stoppage and congestion, turned back from the bridges and slipped stealthily and silently past the church of Vasíli the Beatified and under the Borovítski gate, back up the hill to the Red Square where some instinct told them they could easily take things not belonging to them. Crowds of the kind seen at cheap sales filled all the passages and alleys of the Bazaar.</p>",
  "page-1126": "<p> But there were no dealers with voices of ingratiating affability inviting customers to enter; there were no hawkers, nor the usual motley crowd of female purchasers&mdash;but only soldiers, in uniforms and overcoats though without muskets, entering the Bazaar empty-handed and silently making their way out through its passages with bundles. Tradesmen and their assistants (of whom there were but few) moved about among the soldiers quite bewildered. They unlocked their shops and locked them up again, and themselves carried goods away with the help of their assistants. On the square in front of the Bazaar were drummers beating the muster call. But the roll of the drums did not make the looting soldiers run in the direction of the drum as formerly, but made them, on the contrary, run farther away. Among the soldiers in the shops and passages some men were to be seen in gray coats, with closely shaven heads.</p>",
  "page-1127": "<p> Two officers, one with a scarf over his uniform and mounted on a lean, dark-gray horse, the other in an overcoat and on foot, stood at the corner of Ilyínka Street, talking. A third officer galloped up to them.</p><p>&ldquo;The general orders them all to be driven out at once, without fail. This is outrageous! Half the men have dispersed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you off to?... Where?...&rdquo; he shouted to three infantrymen without muskets who, holding up the skirts of their overcoats, were slipping past him into the Bazaar passage. &ldquo;Stop, you rascals!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But how are you going to stop them?&rdquo; replied another officer. &ldquo;There is no getting them together. The army should push on before the rest bolt, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1128": "<p>&ldquo;How can one push on? They are stuck there, wedged on the bridge, and don&rsquo;t move. Shouldn&rsquo;t we put a cordon round to prevent the rest from running away?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come, go in there and drive them out!&rdquo; shouted the senior officer.</p><p>The officer in the scarf dismounted, called up a drummer, and went with him into the arcade. Some soldiers started running away in a group. A shopkeeper with red pimples on his cheeks near the nose, and a calm, persistent, calculating expression on his plump face, hurriedly and ostentatiously approached the officer, swinging his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Your honor!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Be so good as to protect us! We won&rsquo;t grudge trifles, you are welcome to anything&mdash;we shall be delighted! Pray!... I&rsquo;ll fetch a piece of cloth at once for such an honorable gentleman, or even two pieces with pleasure.</p>",
  "page-1129": "<p> For we feel how it is; but what&rsquo;s all this&mdash;sheer robbery! If you please, could not guards be placed if only to let us close the shop....&rdquo;</p><p>Several shopkeepers crowded round the officer.</p><p>&ldquo;Eh, what twaddle!&rdquo; said one of them, a thin, stern-looking man. &ldquo;When one&rsquo;s head is gone one doesn&rsquo;t weep for one&rsquo;s hair! Take what any of you like!&rdquo; And flourishing his arm energetically he turned sideways to the officer.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well for you, Iván Sidórych, to talk,&rdquo; said the first tradesman angrily. &ldquo;Please step inside, your honor!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1130": "<p>&ldquo;Talk indeed!&rdquo; cried the thin one. &ldquo;In my three shops here I have a hundred thousand rubles&rsquo; worth of goods. Can they be saved when the army has gone? Eh, what people! &lsquo;Against God&rsquo;s might our hands can&rsquo;t fight.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come inside, your honor!&rdquo; repeated the tradesman, bowing.</p><p>The officer stood perplexed and his face showed indecision.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my business!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and strode on quickly down one of the passages.</p><p>From one open shop came the sound of blows and vituperation, and just as the officer came up to it a man in a gray coat with a shaven head was flung out violently.</p>",
  "page-1131": "<p>This man, bent double, rushed past the tradesman and the officer. The officer pounced on the soldiers who were in the shops, but at that moment fearful screams reached them from the huge crowd on the Moskvá bridge and the officer ran out into the square.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it? What is it?&rdquo; he asked, but his comrade was already galloping off past Vasíli the Beatified in the direction from which the screams came.</p><p>The officer mounted his horse and rode after him. When he reached the bridge he saw two unlimbered guns, the infantry crossing the bridge, several overturned carts, and frightened and laughing faces among the troops. Beside the cannon a cart was standing to which two horses were harnessed. Four borzois with collars were pressing close to the wheels.</p>",
  "page-1132": "<p> The cart was loaded high, and at the very top, beside a child&rsquo;s chair with its legs in the air, sat a peasant woman uttering piercing and desperate shrieks. He was told by his fellow officers that the screams of the crowd and the shrieks of the woman were due to the fact that General Ermólov, coming up to the crowd and learning that soldiers were dispersing among the shops while crowds of civilians blocked the bridge, had ordered two guns to be unlimbered and made a show of firing at the bridge. The crowd, crushing one another, upsetting carts, and shouting and squeezing desperately, had cleared off the bridge and the troops were now moving forward.</p>",
  "page-1133": "<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>",
  "page-1134": "<p>Meanwhile, the city itself was deserted. There was hardly anyone in the streets. The gates and shops were all closed, only here and there round the taverns solitary shouts or drunken songs could be heard. Nobody drove through the streets and footsteps were rarely heard. The Povarskáya was quite still and deserted. The huge courtyard of the Rostóvs&rsquo; house was littered with wisps of hay and with dung from the horses, and not a soul was to be seen there. In the great drawing room of the house, which had been left with all it contained, were two people. They were the yard porter Ignát, and the page boy Míshka, Vasílich&rsquo;s grandson who had stayed in Moscow with his grandfather. Míshka had opened the clavichord and was strumming on it with one finger. The yard porter, his arms akimbo, stood smiling with satisfaction before the large mirror.</p>",
  "page-1135": "<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it fine, eh, Uncle Ignát?&rdquo; said the boy, suddenly beginning to strike the keyboard with both hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Only fancy!&rdquo; answered Ignát, surprised at the broadening grin on his face in the mirror.</p><p>&ldquo;Impudence! Impudence!&rdquo; they heard behind them the voice of Mávra Kuzmínichna who had entered silently. &ldquo;How he&rsquo;s grinning, the fat mug! Is that what you&rsquo;re here for? Nothing&rsquo;s cleared away down there and Vasílich is worn out. Just you wait a bit!&rdquo;</p><p>Ignát left off smiling, adjusted his belt, and went out of the room with meekly downcast eyes.</p>",
  "page-1136": "<p>&ldquo;Aunt, I did it gently,&rdquo; said the boy.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you something gently, you monkey you!&rdquo; cried Mávra Kuzmínichna, raising her arm threateningly. &ldquo;Go and get the samovar to boil for your grandfather.&rdquo;</p><p>Mávra Kuzmínichna flicked the dust off the clavichord and closed it, and with a deep sigh left the drawing room and locked its main door.</p><p>Going out into the yard she paused to consider where she should go next&mdash;to drink tea in the servants&rsquo; wing with Vasílich, or into the storeroom to put away what still lay about.</p>",
  "page-1137": "<p>She heard the sound of quick footsteps in the quiet street. Someone stopped at the gate, and the latch rattled as someone tried to open it.

  "page-1138": "<p>&ldquo;They have gone away, sir. Went away yesterday at vespertime,&rdquo; said Mávra Kuzmínichna cordially.</p><p>The young officer standing in the gateway, as if hesitating whether to enter or not, clicked his tongue.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, how annoying!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I should have come yesterday.... Ah, what a pity.&rdquo;</p><p>Meanwhile, Mávra Kuzmínichna was attentively and sympathetically examining the familiar Rostóv features of the young man&rsquo;s face, his tattered coat and trodden-down boots.</p><p>&ldquo;What did you want to see the count for?&rdquo; she asked.</p>",
  "page-1139": "<p>&ldquo;Oh well... it can&rsquo;t be helped!&rdquo; said he in a tone of vexation and placed his hand on the gate as if to leave.</p><p>He again paused in indecision.</p><p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he suddenly said, &ldquo;I am a kinsman of the count&rsquo;s and he has been very kind to me. As you see&rdquo; (he glanced with an amused air and good-natured smile at his coat and boots) &ldquo;my things are worn out and I have no money, so I was going to ask the count...&rdquo;</p><p>Mávra Kuzmínichna did not let him finish.</p>",
  "page-1140": "<p>&ldquo;Just wait a minute, sir. One little moment,&rdquo; said she.</p><p>And as soon as the officer let go of the gate handle she turned and, hurrying away on her old legs, went through the back yard to the servants&rsquo; quarters.</p><p>While Mávra Kuzmínichna was running to her room the officer walked about the yard gazing at his worn-out boots with lowered head and a faint smile on his lips. &ldquo;What a pity I&rsquo;ve missed Uncle! What a nice old woman! Where has she run off to? And how am I to find the nearest way to overtake my regiment, which must by now be getting near the Rogózhski gate?&rdquo; thought he. Just then Mávra Kuzmínichna appeared from behind the corner of the house with a frightened yet resolute look, carrying a rolled-up check kerchief in her hand.</p>",
  "page-1141": "<p> While still a few steps from the officer she unfolded the kerchief and took out of it a white twenty-five-ruble assignat and hastily handed it to him.</p><p>&ldquo;If his excellency had been at home, as a kinsman he would of course... but as it is...&rdquo;</p><p>Mávra Kuzmínichna grew abashed and confused. The officer did not decline, but took the note quietly and thanked her.</p><p>&ldquo;If the count had been at home...&rdquo; Mávra Kuzmínichna went on apologetically. &ldquo;Christ be with you, sir! May God preserve you!&rdquo; said she, bowing as she saw him out.</p>",
  "page-1142": "<p>Swaying his head and smiling as if amused at himself, the officer ran almost at a trot through the deserted streets toward the Yaúza bridge to overtake his regiment.</p><p>But Mávra Kuzmínichna stood at the closed gate for some time with moist eyes, pensively swaying her head and feeling an unexpected flow of motherly tenderness and pity for the unknown young officer.</p>",

  "page-1144": "<p>From an unfinished house on the Varvárka, the ground floor of which was a dramshop, came drunken shouts and songs. On benches round the tables in a dirty little room sat some ten factory hands. Tipsy and perspiring, with dim eyes and wide-open mouths, they were all laboriously singing some song or other. They were singing discordantly, arduously, and with great effort, evidently not because they wished to sing, but because they wanted to show they were drunk and on a spree. One, a tall, fair-haired lad in a clean blue coat, was standing over the others. His face with its fine straight nose would have been handsome had it not been for his thin, compressed, twitching lips and dull, gloomy, fixed eyes. Evidently possessed by some idea, he stood over those who were singing, and solemnly and jerkily flourished above their heads his white arm with the sleeve turned up to the elbow, trying unnaturally to spread out his dirty fingers.</p>",
  "page-1145": "<p> The sleeve of his coat kept slipping down and he always carefully rolled it up again with his left hand, as if it were most important that the sinewy white arm he was flourishing should be bare. In the midst of the song cries were heard, and fighting and blows in the passage and porch. The tall lad waved his arm.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; he exclaimed peremptorily. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fight, lads!&rdquo; And, still rolling up his sleeve, he went out to the porch.</p><p>The factory hands followed him. These men, who under the leadership of the tall lad were drinking in the dramshop that morning, had brought the publican some skins from the factory and for this had had drink served them. The blacksmiths from a neighboring smithy, hearing the sounds of revelry in the tavern and supposing it to have been broken into, wished to force their way in too and a fight in the porch had resulted.</p>",
  "page-1146": "<p>The publican was fighting one of the smiths at the door, and when the workmen came out the smith, wrenching himself free from the tavern keeper, fell face downward on the pavement.</p><p>Another smith tried to enter the doorway, pressing against the publican with his chest.</p><p>The lad with the turned-up sleeve gave the smith a blow in the face and cried wildly: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re fighting us, lads!&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment the first smith got up and, scratching his bruised face to make it bleed, shouted in a tearful voice: &ldquo;Police! Murder!... They&rsquo;ve killed a man, lads!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1147": "<p>&ldquo;Oh, gracious me, a man beaten to death&mdash;killed!...&rdquo; screamed a woman coming out of a gate close by.</p><p>A crowd gathered round the bloodstained smith.</p><p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you robbed people enough&mdash;taking their last shirts?&rdquo; said a voice addressing the publican. &ldquo;What have you killed a man for, you thief?&rdquo;</p><p>The tall lad, standing in the porch, turned his bleared eyes from the publican to the smith and back again as if considering whom he ought to fight now.</p><p>&ldquo;Murderer!&rdquo; he shouted suddenly to the publican. &ldquo;Bind him, lads!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1148": "<p>&ldquo;I daresay you would like to bind me!&rdquo; shouted the publican, pushing away the men advancing on him, and snatching his cap from his head he flung it on the ground.</p><p>As if this action had some mysterious and menacing significance, the workmen surrounding the publican paused in indecision.</p><p>&ldquo;I know the law very well, mates! I&rsquo;ll take the matter to the captain of police. You think I won&rsquo;t get to him? Robbery is not permitted to anybody nowadays!&rdquo; shouted the publican, picking up his cap.</p><p>&ldquo;Come along then! Come along then!&rdquo; the publican and the tall young fellow repeated one after the other, and they moved up the street together.</p>",
  "page-1149": "<p>The bloodstained smith went beside them. The factory hands and others followed behind, talking and shouting.</p><p>At the corner of the Moroséyka, opposite a large house with closed shutters and bearing a bootmaker&rsquo;s signboard, stood a score of thin, worn-out, gloomy-faced bootmakers, wearing overalls and long tattered coats.</p><p>&ldquo;He should pay folks off properly,&rdquo; a thin workingman, with frowning brows and a straggly beard, was saying.</p><p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s sucked our blood and now he thinks he&rsquo;s quit of us. He&rsquo;s been misleading us all the week and now that he&rsquo;s brought us to this pass he&rsquo;s made off.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1150": "<p>On seeing the crowd and the bloodstained man the workman ceased speaking, and with eager curiosity all the bootmakers joined the moving crowd.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are all the folks going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, to the police, of course!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I say, is it true that we have been beaten?&rdquo; &ldquo;And what did you think? Look what folks are saying.&rdquo;</p><p>Questions and answers were heard. The publican, taking advantage of the increased crowd, dropped behind and returned to his tavern.</p><p>The tall youth, not noticing the disappearance of his foe, waved his bare arm and went on talking incessantly, attracting general attention to himself. It was around him that the people chiefly crowded, expecting answers from him to the questions that occupied all their minds.</p>",
  "page-1151": "<p>&ldquo;He must keep order, keep the law, that&rsquo;s what the government is there for. Am I not right, good Christians?&rdquo; said the tall youth, with a scarcely perceptible smile. &ldquo;He thinks there&rsquo;s no government! How can one do without government? Or else there would be plenty who&rsquo;d rob us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why talk nonsense?&rdquo; rejoined voices in the crowd. &ldquo;Will they give up Moscow like this? They told you that for fun, and you believed it! Aren&rsquo;t there plenty of troops on the march? Let him in, indeed! That&rsquo;s what the government is for. You&rsquo;d better listen to what people are saying,&rdquo; said some of the mob pointing to the tall youth.</p>",
  "page-1152": "<p>By the wall of China-Town a smaller group of people were gathered round a man in a frieze coat who held a paper in his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;An ukáse, they are reading an ukáse! Reading an ukáse!&rdquo; cried voices in the crowd, and the people rushed toward the reader.</p><p>The man in the frieze coat was reading the broadsheet of August 31. When the crowd collected round him he seemed confused, but at the demand of the tall lad who had pushed his way up to him, he began in a rather tremulous voice to read the sheet from the beginning.</p><p>&ldquo;Early tomorrow I shall go to his Serene Highness,&rdquo; he read (&ldquo;Sirin Highness,&rdquo; said the tall fellow with a triumphant smile on his lips and a frown on his brow), &ldquo;to consult with him to act, and to aid the army to exterminate these scoundrels.</p>",
  "page-1153": "<p> We too will take part...&rdquo; the reader went on, and then paused (&ldquo;Do you see,&rdquo; shouted the youth victoriously, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s going to clear up the whole affair for you....&rdquo;), &ldquo;in destroying them, and will send these visitors to the devil. I will come back to dinner, and we&rsquo;ll set to work. We will do, completely do, and undo these scoundrels.&rdquo;</p><p>The last words were read out in the midst of complete silence. The tall lad hung his head gloomily. It was evident that no one had understood the last part. In particular, the words &ldquo;I will come back to dinner,&rdquo; evidently displeased both reader and audience. The people&rsquo;s minds were tuned to a high pitch and this was too simple and needlessly comprehensible&mdash;</p>",
  "page-1154": "<p>it was what anyone of them might have said and therefore was what an ukáse emanating from the highest authority should not say.</p><p>They all stood despondent and silent. The tall youth moved his lips and swayed from side to side.</p><p>&ldquo;We should ask him... that&rsquo;s he himself?&rdquo;... &ldquo;Yes, ask him indeed!... Why not? He&rsquo;ll explain&rdquo;... voices in the rear of the crowd were suddenly heard saying, and the general attention turned to the police superintendent&rsquo;s trap which drove into the square attended by two mounted dragoons.</p><p>The superintendent of police, who had gone that morning by Count Rostopchín&rsquo;s orders to burn the barges and had in connection with that matter acquired a large sum of money which was at that moment in his pocket, on seeing a crowd bearing down upon him told his coachman to stop.</p>",
  "page-1155": "<p>&ldquo;What people are these?&rdquo; he shouted to the men, who were moving singly and timidly in the direction of his trap.</p><p>&ldquo;What people are these?&rdquo; he shouted again, receiving no answer.</p><p>&ldquo;Your honor...&rdquo; replied the shopman in the frieze coat, &ldquo;your honor, in accord with the proclamation of his highest excellency the count, they desire to serve, not sparing their lives, and it is not any kind of riot, but as his highest excellence said...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The count has not left, he is here, and an order will be issued concerning you,&rdquo; said the superintendent of police. &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; he ordered his coachman.</p>",
  "page-1156": "<p>The crowd halted, pressing around those who had heard what the superintendent had said, and looking at the departing trap.</p><p>The superintendent of police turned round at that moment with a scared look, said something to his coachman, and his horses increased their speed.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fraud, lads! Lead the way to him, himself!&rdquo; shouted the tall youth. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him go, lads! Let him answer us! Keep him!&rdquo; shouted different people and the people dashed in pursuit of the trap.</p><p>Following the superintendent of police and talking loudly the crowd went in the direction of the Lubyánka Street.</p>",

  "page-1158": "<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>",
  "page-1159": "<p>On the evening of the first of September, after his interview with Kutúzov, Count Rostopchín had returned to Moscow mortified and offended because he had not been invited to attend the council of war, and because Kutúzov had paid no attention to his offer to take part in the defense of the city; amazed also at the novel outlook revealed to him at the camp, which treated the tranquillity of the capital and its patriotic fervor as not merely secondary but quite irrelevant and unimportant matters. Distressed, offended, and surprised by all this, Rostopchín had returned to Moscow. After supper he lay down on a sofa without undressing, and was awakened soon after midnight by a courier bringing him a letter from Kutúzov. This letter requested the count to send police officers to guide the troops through the town, as the army was retreating to the Ryazán road beyond Moscow. This was not news to Rostopchín.</p>",
  "page-1160": "<p> He had known that Moscow would be abandoned not merely since his interview the previous day with Kutúzov on the Poklónny Hill but ever since the battle of Borodinó, for all the generals who came to Moscow after that battle had said unanimously that it was impossible to fight another battle, and since then the government property had been removed every night, and half the inhabitants had left the city with Rostopchín&rsquo;s own permission. Yet all the same this information astonished and irritated the count, coming as it did in the form of a simple note with an order from Kutúzov, and received at night, breaking in on his beauty sleep.</p><p>When later on in his memoirs Count Rostopchín explained his actions at this time, he repeatedly says that he was then actuated by two important considerations:</p>",
  "page-1161": "<p> to maintain tranquillity in Moscow and expedite the departure of the inhabitants. If one accepts this twofold aim all Rostopchín&rsquo;s actions appear irreproachable. &ldquo;Why were the holy relics, the arms, ammunition, gunpowder, and stores of corn not removed? Why were thousands of inhabitants deceived into believing that Moscow would not be given up&mdash;and thereby ruined?&rdquo; &ldquo;To preserve the tranquillity of the city,&rdquo; explains Count Rostopchín. &ldquo;Why were bundles of useless papers from the government offices, and Leppich&rsquo;s balloon and other articles removed?&rdquo; &ldquo;To leave the town empty,&rdquo; explains Count Rostopchín. One need only admit that public tranquillity is in danger and any action finds a justification.</p><p>All the horrors of the reign of terror were based only on solicitude for public tranquillity.</p>",
  "page-1162": "<p>On what, then, was Count Rostopchín&rsquo;s fear for the tranquillity of Moscow based in 1812? What reason was there for assuming any probability of an uprising in the city? The inhabitants were leaving it and the retreating troops were filling it. Why should that cause the masses to riot?</p><p>Neither in Moscow nor anywhere in Russia did anything resembling an insurrection ever occur when the enemy entered a town. More than ten thousand people were still in Moscow on the first and second of September, and except for a mob in the governor&rsquo;s courtyard, assembled there at his bidding, nothing happened. It is obvious that there would have been even less reason to expect a disturbance among the people if after the battle of Borodinó, when the surrender of Moscow became certain or at least probable, Rostopchín instead of exciting the people by distributing arms and broadsheets had taken steps to</p>",
  "page-1163": "<p>remove all the holy relics, the gunpowder, munitions, and money, and had told the population plainly that the town would be abandoned.</p><p>Rostopchín, though he had patriotic sentiments, was a sanguine and impulsive man who had always moved in the highest administrative circles and had no understanding at all of the people he supposed himself to be guiding. Ever since the enemy&rsquo;s entry into Smolénsk he had in imagination been playing the role of director of the popular feeling of &ldquo;the heart of Russia.&rdquo; Not only did it seem to him (as to all administrators) that he controlled the external actions of Moscow&rsquo;s inhabitants, but he also thought he controlled their mental attitude by means of his broadsheets and posters, written in a coarse tone which the people despise in their own class and do not understand from those in authority.</p>",
  "page-1164": "<p> Rostopchín was so pleased with the fine role of leader of popular feeling, and had grown so used to it, that the necessity of relinquishing that role and abandoning Moscow without any heroic display took him unawares and he suddenly felt the ground slip away from under his feet, so that he positively did not know what to do. Though he knew it was coming, he did not till the last moment wholeheartedly believe that Moscow would be abandoned, and did not prepare for it. The inhabitants left against his wishes. If the government offices were removed, this was only done on the demand of officials to whom the count yielded reluctantly. He was absorbed in the role he had created for himself. As is often the case with those gifted with an ardent imagination, though he had long known that Moscow would be abandoned he knew it only with his intellect, he did not believe it in his heart and did not adapt himself mentally to this new position of affairs.</p>",
  "page-1165": "<p>All his painstaking and energetic activity (in how far it was useful and had any effect on the people is another question) had been simply directed toward arousing in the masses his own feeling of patriotic hatred of the French.</p><p>But when events assumed their true historical character, when expressing hatred for the French in words proved insufficient, when it was not even possible to express that hatred by fighting a battle, when self-confidence was of no avail in relation to the one question before Moscow, when the whole population streamed out of Moscow as one man, abandoning their belongings and proving by that negative action all the depth of their national feeling, then the role chosen by Rostopchín suddenly appeared senseless. He unexpectedly felt himself ridiculous, weak, and alone, with no ground to stand on.</p>",
  "page-1166": "<p>When, awakened from his sleep, he received that cold, peremptory note from Kutúzov, he felt the more irritated the more he felt himself to blame. All that he had been specially put in charge of, the state property which he should have removed, was still in Moscow and it was no longer possible to take the whole of it away.</p><p>&ldquo;Who is to blame for it? Who has let things come to such a pass?&rdquo; he ruminated. &ldquo;Not I, of course. I had everything ready. I had Moscow firmly in hand. And this is what they have let it come to! Villains! Traitors!&rdquo; he thought, without clearly defining who the villains and traitors were, but feeling it necessary to hate those traitors whoever they might be who were to blame for the false and ridiculous position in which he found himself.</p>",
  "page-1167": "<p>All that night Count Rostopchín issued orders, for which people came to him from all parts of Moscow. Those about him had never seen the count so morose and irritable.</p><p>&ldquo;Your excellency, the Director of the Registrar&rsquo;s Department has sent for instructions.... From the Consistory, from the Senate, from the University, from the Foundling Hospital, the Suffragan has sent... asking for information.... What are your orders about the Fire Brigade? From the governor of the prison... from the superintendent of the lunatic asylum...&rdquo; All night long such announcements were continually being received by the count.</p><p>To all these inquiries he gave brief and angry replies indicating that orders from him were not now needed, that the whole affair, carefully prepared by him, had now been ruined by somebody, and that that somebody would have to bear the whole responsibility for all that might happen.</p>",
  "page-1168": "<p>&ldquo;Oh, tell that blockhead,&rdquo; he said in reply to the question from the Registrar&rsquo;s Department, &ldquo;that he should remain to guard his documents. Now why are you asking silly questions about the Fire Brigade? They have horses, let them be off to Vladímir, and not leave them to the French.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your excellency, the superintendent of the lunatic asylum has come: what are your commands?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My commands? Let them go away, that&rsquo;s all.... And let the lunatics out into the town. When lunatics command our armies God evidently means these other madmen to be free.&rdquo;</p><p>In reply to an inquiry about the convicts in the prison, Count Rostopchín shouted angrily at the governor:</p>",
  "page-1169": "<p>&ldquo;Do you expect me to give you two battalions&mdash;which we have not got&mdash;for a convoy? Release them, that&rsquo;s all about it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your excellency, there are some political prisoners, Meshkóv, Vereshchágin...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Vereshchágin! Hasn&rsquo;t he been hanged yet?&rdquo; shouted Rostopchín. &ldquo;Bring him to me!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1170": "<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>",
  "page-1171": "<p>Toward nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning, when the troops were already moving through Moscow, nobody came to the count any more for instructions. Those who were able to get away were going of their own accord, those who remained behind decided for themselves what they must do.</p><p>The count ordered his carriage that he might drive to Sokólniki, and sat in his study with folded hands, morose, sallow, and taciturn.</p><p>In quiet and untroubled times it seems to every administrator that it is only by his efforts that the whole population under his rule is kept going, and in this consciousness of being indispensable every administrator finds the chief reward of his labor and efforts. While the sea of history remains calm the ruler-administrator in his frail bark, holding on with a boat hook to the ship of the people and himself moving, naturally imagines that his efforts move the ship he is holding on to.</p>",
  "page-1172": "<p> But as soon as a storm arises and the sea begins to heave and the ship to move, such a delusion is no longer possible. The ship moves independently with its own enormous motion, the boat hook no longer reaches the moving vessel, and suddenly the administrator, instead of appearing a ruler and a source of power, becomes an insignificant, useless, feeble man.</p><p>Rostopchín felt this, and it was this which exasperated him.</p><p>The superintendent of police, whom the crowd had stopped, went in to see him at the same time as an adjutant who informed the count that the horses were harnessed. They were both pale, and the superintendent of police, after reporting that he had executed the instructions he had received, informed the count that an immense crowd had collected in the courtyard and wished to see him.</p>",
  "page-1173": "<p>Without saying a word Rostopchín rose and walked hastily to his light, luxurious drawing room, went to the balcony door, took hold of the handle, let it go again, and went to the window from which he had a better view of the whole crowd. The tall lad was standing in front, flourishing his arm and saying something with a stern look. The blood-stained smith stood beside him with a gloomy face. A drone of voices was audible through the closed window.</p><p>&ldquo;Is my carriage ready?&rdquo; asked Rostopchín, stepping back from the window.</p><p>&ldquo;It is, your excellency,&rdquo; replied the adjutant.</p><p>Rostopchín went again to the balcony door.</p>",
  "page-1174": "<p>&ldquo;But what do they want?&rdquo; he asked the superintendent of police.</p><p>&ldquo;Your excellency, they say they have got ready, according to your orders, to go against the French, and they shouted something about treachery. But it is a turbulent crowd, your excellency&mdash;I hardly managed to get away from it. Your excellency, I venture to suggest...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You may go. I don&rsquo;t need you to tell me what to do!&rdquo; exclaimed Rostopchín angrily.</p><p>He stood by the balcony door looking at the crowd.</p><p>&ldquo;This is what they have done with Russia! This is what they have done with me!&rdquo; thought he, full of an irrepressible fury that welled up within him against the someone to whom what was happening might be attributed. As often happens with passionate people, he was mastered by anger but was still seeking an object on which to vent it.</p>",
  "page-1175": "<p> &ldquo;Here is that mob, the dregs of the people,&rdquo; he thought as he gazed at the crowd: &ldquo;this rabble they have roused by their folly! They want a victim,&rdquo; he thought as he looked at the tall lad flourishing his arm. And this thought occurred to him just because he himself desired a victim, something on which to vent his rage.</p><p>&ldquo;Is the carriage ready?&rdquo; he asked again.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, your excellency. What are your orders about Vereshchágin? He is waiting at the porch,&rdquo; said the adjutant.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Rostopchín, as if struck by an unexpected recollection.</p>",
  "page-1176": "<p>And rapidly opening the door he went resolutely out onto the balcony. The talking instantly ceased, hats and caps were doffed, and all eyes were raised to the count.</p><p>&ldquo;Good morning, lads!&rdquo; said the count briskly and loudly. &ldquo;Thank you for coming. I&rsquo;ll come out to you in a moment, but we must first settle with the villain. We must punish the villain who has caused the ruin of Moscow. Wait for me!&rdquo;</p><p>And the count stepped as briskly back into the room and slammed the door behind him.</p><p>A murmur of approbation and satisfaction ran through the crowd. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll settle with all the villains, you&rsquo;ll see! And you said the French... He&rsquo;ll show you what law is!&rdquo; the mob were saying as if reproving one another for their lack of confidence.</p>",
  "page-1177": "<p>A few minutes later an officer came hurriedly out of the front door, gave an order, and the dragoons formed up in line. The crowd moved eagerly from the balcony toward the porch. Rostopchín, coming out there with quick angry steps, looked hastily around as if seeking someone.</p><p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; he inquired. And as he spoke he saw a young man coming round the corner of the house between two dragoons. He had a long thin neck, and his head, that had been half shaved, was again covered by short hair. This young man was dressed in a threadbare blue cloth coat lined with fox fur, that had once been smart, and dirty hempen convict trousers, over which were pulled his thin, dirty, trodden-down boots. On his thin, weak legs were heavy chains which hampered his irresolute movements.</p>",
  "page-1178": "<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Rostopchín, hurriedly turning away his eyes from the young man in the fur-lined coat and pointing to the bottom step of the porch. &ldquo;Put him there.&rdquo;</p><p>The young man in his clattering chains stepped clumsily to the spot indicated, holding away with one finger the coat collar which chafed his neck, turned his long neck twice this way and that, sighed, and submissively folded before him his thin hands, unused to work.</p><p>For several seconds while the young man was taking his place on the step the silence continued. Only among the back rows of the people, who were all pressing toward the one spot, could sighs, groans, and the shuffling of feet be heard.</p>",
  "page-1179": "<p>While waiting for the young man to take his place on the step Rostopchín stood frowning and rubbing his face with his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Lads!&rdquo; said he, with a metallic ring in his voice. &ldquo;This man, Vereshchágin, is the scoundrel by whose doing Moscow is perishing.&rdquo;</p><p>The young man in the fur-lined coat, stooping a little, stood in a submissive attitude, his fingers clasped before him. His emaciated young face, disfigured by the half-shaven head, hung down hopelessly. At the count&rsquo;s first words he raised it slowly and looked up at him as if wishing to say something or at least to meet his eye. But Rostopchín did not look at him. A vein in the young man&rsquo;s long thin neck swelled like a cord and went blue behind the ear, and suddenly his face flushed.</p>",
  "page-1180": "<p>All eyes were fixed on him. He looked at the crowd, and rendered more hopeful by the expression he read on the faces there, he smiled sadly and timidly, and lowering his head shifted his feet on the step.</p><p>&ldquo;He has betrayed his Tsar and his country, he has gone over to Bonaparte. He alone of all the Russians has disgraced the Russian name, he has caused Moscow to perish,&rdquo; said Rostopchín in a sharp, even voice, but suddenly he glanced down at Vereshchágin who continued to stand in the same submissive attitude. As if inflamed by the sight, he raised his arm and addressed the people, almost shouting:</p>",
  "page-1181": "<p>&ldquo;Deal with him as you think fit! I hand him over to you.&rdquo;</p><p>The crowd remained silent and only pressed closer and closer to one another. To keep one another back, to breathe in that stifling atmosphere, to be unable to stir, and to await something unknown, uncomprehended, and terrible, was becoming unbearable. Those standing in front, who had seen and heard what had taken place before them, all stood with wide-open eyes and mouths, straining with all their strength, and held back the crowd that was pushing behind them.</p><p>&ldquo;Beat him!... Let the traitor perish and not disgrace the Russian name!&rdquo; shouted Rostopchín. &ldquo;Cut him down. I command it.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1182": "<p>Hearing not so much the words as the angry tone of Rostopchín&rsquo;s voice, the crowd moaned and heaved forward, but again paused.</p><p>&ldquo;Count!&rdquo; exclaimed the timid yet theatrical voice of Vereshchágin in the midst of the momentary silence that ensued, &ldquo;Count! One God is above us both....&rdquo; He lifted his head and again the thick vein in his thin neck filled with blood and the color rapidly came and went in his face.</p><p>He did not finish what he wished to say.</p><p>&ldquo;Cut him down! I command it...&rdquo; shouted Rostopchín, suddenly growing pale like Vereshchágin.</p>",
  "page-1183": "<p>&ldquo;Draw sabers!&rdquo; cried the dragoon officer, drawing his own.</p><p>Another still stronger wave flowed through the crowd and reaching the front ranks carried it swaying to the very steps of the porch. The tall youth, with a stony look on his face, and rigid and uplifted arm, stood beside Vereshchágin.</p><p>&ldquo;Saber him!&rdquo; the dragoon officer almost whispered.</p><p>And one of the soldiers, his face all at once distorted with fury, struck Vereshchágin on the head with the blunt side of his saber.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Vereshchágin in meek surprise, looking round with a frightened glance as if not understanding why this was done to him. A similar moan of surprise and horror ran through the crowd. &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; exclaimed a sorrowful voice.</p>",
  "page-1184": "<p>But after the exclamation of surprise that had escaped from Vereshchágin he uttered a plaintive cry of pain, and that cry was fatal. The barrier of human feeling, strained to the utmost, that had held the crowd in check suddenly broke. The crime had begun and must now be completed. The plaintive moan of reproach was drowned by the threatening and angry roar of the crowd. Like the seventh and last wave that shatters a ship, that last irresistible wave burst from the rear and reached the front ranks, carrying them off their feet and engulfing them all. The dragoon was about to repeat his blow. Vereshchágin with a cry of horror, covering his head with his hands, rushed toward the crowd. The tall youth, against whom he stumbled, seized his thin neck with his hands and, yelling wildly, fell with him under the feet of the pressing, struggling crowd.</p>",
  "page-1185": "<p>Some beat and tore at Vereshchágin, others at the tall youth. And the screams of those that were being trampled on and of those who tried to rescue the tall lad only increased the fury of the crowd. It was a long time before the dragoons could extricate the bleeding youth, beaten almost to death. And for a long time, despite the feverish haste with which the mob tried to end the work that had been begun, those who were hitting, throttling, and tearing at Vereshchágin were unable to kill him, for the crowd pressed from all sides, swaying as one mass with them in the center and rendering it impossible for them either to kill him or let him go.</p>",
  "page-1186": "<p>&ldquo;Hit him with an ax, eh!... Crushed?... Traitor, he sold Christ.... Still alive... tenacious... serves him right! Torture serves a thief right. Use the hatchet!... What&mdash;still alive?&rdquo;</p><p>Only when the victim ceased to struggle and his cries changed to a long-drawn, measured death rattle did the crowd around his prostrate, bleeding corpse begin rapidly to change places. Each one came up, glanced at what had been done, and with horror, reproach, and astonishment pushed back again.</p><p>&ldquo;O Lord! The people are like wild beasts! How could he be alive?&rdquo; voices in the crowd could be heard saying. &ldquo;Quite a young fellow too... must have been a merchant&rsquo;s son. What men!... and they say he&rsquo;s not the right one.... How not the right one?... O Lord! And there&rsquo;s another has been beaten too&mdash;they say he&rsquo;s nearly done for.... Oh, the people... Aren&rsquo;t they afraid of sinning?...</p>",
  "page-1187": "<p>&rdquo; said the same mob now, looking with pained distress at the dead body with its long, thin, half-severed neck and its livid face stained with blood and dust.</p><p>A painstaking police officer, considering the presence of a corpse in his excellency&rsquo;s courtyard unseemly, told the dragoons to take it away. Two dragoons took it by its distorted legs and dragged it along the ground. The gory, dust-stained, half-shaven head with its long neck trailed twisting along the ground. The crowd shrank back from it.</p><p>At the moment when Vereshchágin fell and the crowd closed in with savage yells and swayed about him, Rostopchín suddenly turned pale and, instead of going to the back entrance where his carriage awaited him, went with hurried steps and bent head, not knowing where and why, along the passage leading to the rooms on the ground floor. The count&rsquo;s face was white and he could not control the feverish twitching of his lower jaw.</p>",
  "page-1188": "<p>&ldquo;This way, your excellency... Where are you going?... This way, please...&rdquo; said a trembling, frightened voice behind him.</p><p>Count Rostopchín was unable to reply and, turning obediently, went in the direction indicated. At the back entrance stood his calèche. The distant roar of the yelling crowd was audible even there. He hastily took his seat and told the coachman to drive him to his country house in Sokólniki.</p><p>When they reached the Myasnítski Street and could no longer hear the shouts of the mob, the count began to repent. He remembered with dissatisfaction the agitation and fear he had betrayed before his subordinates. &ldquo;The mob is terrible&mdash;disgusting,&rdquo; he said to himself in French. &ldquo;They are like wolves whom nothing but flesh can appease.</p>",
  "page-1189": "<p>&rdquo; &ldquo;Count! One God is above us both!&rdquo;&mdash;Vereshchágin&rsquo;s words suddenly recurred to him, and a disagreeable shiver ran down his back. But this was only a momentary feeling and Count Rostopchín smiled disdainfully at himself. &ldquo;I had other duties,&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;The people had to be appeased. Many other victims have perished and are perishing for the public good&rdquo;&mdash;and he began thinking of his social duties to his family and to the city entrusted to him, and of himself&mdash;not himself as Theodore Vasílyevich Rostopchín (he fancied that Theodore Vasílyevich Rostopchín was sacrificing himself for the public good) but himself as governor, the representative of authority and of the Tsar. &ldquo;Had I been simply Theodore Vasílyevich my course of action would have been quite different, but it was my duty to safeguard my life and dignity as commander in chief.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1190": "<p>Lightly swaying on the flexible springs of his carriage and no longer hearing the terrible sounds of the crowd, Rostopchín grew physically calm and, as always happens, as soon as he became physically tranquil his mind devised reasons why he should be mentally tranquil too. The thought which tranquillized Rostopchín was not a new one. Since the world began and men have killed one another no one has ever committed such a crime against his fellow man without comforting himself with this same idea. This idea is le bien public, the hypothetical welfare of other people.</p><p>To a man not swayed by passion that welfare is never certain, but he who commits such a crime always knows just where that welfare lies. And Rostopchín now knew it.</p>",
  "page-1191": "<p>Not only did his reason not reproach him for what he had done, but he even found cause for self-satisfaction in having so successfully contrived to avail himself of a convenient opportunity to punish a criminal and at the same time pacify the mob.</p><p>&ldquo;Vereshchágin was tried and condemned to death,&rdquo; thought Rostopchín (though the Senate had only condemned Vereshchágin to hard labor), &ldquo;he was a traitor and a spy. I could not let him go unpunished and so I have killed two birds with one stone: to appease the mob I gave them a victim and at the same time punished a miscreant.&rdquo;</p><p>Having reached his country house and begun to give orders about domestic arrangements, the count grew quite tranquil.</p>",
  "page-1192": "<p>Half an hour later he was driving with his fast horses across the Sokólniki field, no longer thinking of what had occurred but considering what was to come. He was driving to the Yaúza bridge where he had heard that Kutúzov was. Count Rostopchín was mentally preparing the angry and stinging reproaches he meant to address to Kutúzov for his deception. He would make that foxy old courtier feel that the responsibility for all the calamities that would follow the abandonment of the city and the ruin of Russia (as Rostopchín regarded it) would fall upon his doting old head. Planning beforehand what he would say to Kutúzov, Rostopchín turned angrily in his calèche and gazed sternly from side to side.</p>",
  "page-1193": "<p>The Sokólniki field was deserted. Only at the end of it, in front of the almshouse and the lunatic asylum, could be seen some people in white and others like them walking singly across the field shouting and gesticulating.</p><p>One of these was running to cross the path of Count Rostopchín&rsquo;s carriage, and the count himself, his coachman, and his dragoons looked with vague horror and curiosity at these released lunatics and especially at the one running toward them.</p><p>Swaying from side to side on his long, thin legs in his fluttering dressing gown, this lunatic was running impetuously, his gaze fixed on Rostopchín, shouting something in a hoarse voice and making signs to him to stop. The lunatic&rsquo;s solemn, gloomy face was thin and yellow, with its beard growing in uneven tufts. His black, agate pupils with saffron-yellow whites moved restlessly near the lower eyelids.</p>",
  "page-1194": "<p>&ldquo;Stop! Pull up, I tell you!&rdquo; he cried in a piercing voice, and again shouted something breathlessly with emphatic intonations and gestures.</p><p>Coming abreast of the calèche he ran beside it.</p><p>&ldquo;Thrice have they slain me, thrice have I risen from the dead. They stoned me, crucified me... I shall rise... shall rise... shall rise. They have torn my body. The kingdom of God will be overthrown... Thrice will I overthrow it and thrice re-establish it!&rdquo; he cried, raising his voice higher and higher.</p><p>Count Rostopchín suddenly grew pale as he had done when the crowd closed in on Vereshchágin. He turned away. &ldquo;Go fas... faster!&rdquo; he cried in a trembling voice to his coachman. The calèche flew over the ground as fast as the horses could draw it, but for a long time Count Rostopchín still heard the insane despairing screams growing fainter in the distance, while his eyes saw nothing but the astonished, frightened, bloodstained face of &ldquo;the traitor&rdquo; in the fur-lined coat.</p>",
  "page-1195": "<p>Recent as that mental picture was, Rostopchín already felt that it had cut deep into his heart and drawn blood. Even now he felt clearly that the gory trace of that recollection would not pass with time, but that the terrible memory would, on the contrary, dwell in his heart ever more cruelly and painfully to the end of his life. He seemed still to hear the sound of his own words: &ldquo;Cut him down! I command it....&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why did I utter those words? It was by some accident I said them.... I need not have said them,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;And then nothing would have happened.&rdquo; He saw the frightened and then infuriated face of the dragoon who dealt the blow, the look of silent, timid reproach that boy in the fur-lined coat had turned upon him. &ldquo;But I did not do it for my own sake. I was bound to act that way.... The mob, the traitor... the public welfare,&rdquo; thought he.</p>",
  "page-1196": "<p>Troops were still crowding at the Yaúza bridge. It was hot. Kutúzov, dejected and frowning, sat on a bench by the bridge toying with his whip in the sand when a calèche dashed up noisily. A man in a general&rsquo;s uniform with plumes in his hat went up to Kutúzov and said something in French. It was Count Rostopchín. He told Kutúzov that he had come because Moscow, the capital, was no more and only the army remained.</p><p>&ldquo;Things would have been different if your Serene Highness had not told me that you would not abandon Moscow without another battle; all this would not have happened,&rdquo; he said.</p>",
  "page-1197": "<p>Kutúzov looked at Rostopchín as if, not grasping what was said to him, he was trying to read something peculiar written at that moment on the face of the man addressing him. Rostopchín grew confused and became silent. Kutúzov slightly shook his head and not taking his penetrating gaze from Rostopchín&rsquo;s face muttered softly:</p><p>&ldquo;No! I shall not give up Moscow without a battle!&rdquo;</p><p>Whether Kutúzov was thinking of something entirely different when he spoke those words, or uttered them purposely, knowing them to be meaningless, at any rate Rostopchín made no reply and hastily left him. And strange to say, the Governor of Moscow, the proud Count Rostopchín, took up a Cossack whip and went to the bridge where he began with shouts to drive on the carts that blocked the way.</p>",
  "page-1198": "<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>",
  "page-1199": "<p>Toward four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon Murat&rsquo;s troops were entering Moscow. In front rode a detachment of Württemberg hussars and behind them rode the King of Naples himself accompanied by a numerous suite.</p><p>About the middle of the Arbát Street, near the Church of the Miraculous Icon of St. Nicholas, Murat halted to await news from the advanced detachment as to the condition in which they had found the citadel, le Kremlin.</p><p>Around Murat gathered a group of those who had remained in Moscow. They all stared in timid bewilderment at the strange, long-haired commander dressed up in feathers and gold.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that their Tsar himself? He&rsquo;s not bad!&rdquo; low voices could be heard saying.</p>",
  "page-1200": "<p>An interpreter rode up to the group.</p><p>&ldquo;Take off your cap... your caps!&rdquo; These words went from one to another in the crowd. The interpreter addressed an old porter and asked if it was far to the Krémlin. The porter, listening in perplexity to the unfamiliar Polish accent and not realizing that the interpreter was speaking Russian, did not understand what was being said to him and slipped behind the others.</p><p>Murat approached the interpreter and told him to ask where the Russian army was. One of the Russians understood what was asked and several voices at once began answering the interpreter. A French officer, returning from the advanced detachment, rode up to Murat and reported that the gates of the citadel had been barricaded and that there was probably an ambuscade there.</p>",
  "page-1201": "<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Murat and, turning to one of the gentlemen in his suite, ordered four light guns to be moved forward to fire at the gates.</p><p>The guns emerged at a trot from the column following Murat and advanced up the Arbát. When they reached the end of the Vozdvízhenka Street they halted and drew in the Square. Several French officers superintended the placing of the guns and looked at the Krémlin through field glasses.</p><p>The bells in the Krémlin were ringing for vespers, and this sound troubled the French. They imagined it to be a call to arms. A few infantrymen ran to the Kutáfyev Gate. Beams and wooden screens had been put there, and two musket shots rang out from under the gate as soon as an officer and men began to run toward it.</p>",
  "page-1202": "<p> A general who was standing by the guns shouted some words of command to the officer, and the latter ran back again with his men.</p><p>The sound of three more shots came from the gate.</p><p>One shot struck a French soldier&rsquo;s foot, and from behind the screens came the strange sound of a few voices shouting. Instantly as at a word of command the expression of cheerful serenity on the faces of the French general, officers, and men changed to one of determined concentrated readiness for strife and suffering. To all of them from the marshal to the least soldier, that place was not the Vozdvízhenka, Mokhaváya, or Kutáfyev Street, nor the Tróitsa Gate (places familiar in Moscow), but a new battlefield which would probably prove sanguinary. And all made ready for that battle. The cries from the gates ceased.</p>",
  "page-1203": "<p> The guns were advanced, the artillerymen blew the ash off their linstocks, and an officer gave the word &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; This was followed by two whistling sounds of canister shot, one after another. The shot rattled against the stone of the gate and upon the wooden beams and screens, and two wavering clouds of smoke rose over the Square.</p><p>A few instants after the echo of the reports resounding over the stone-built Krémlin had died away the French heard a strange sound above their head. Thousands of crows rose above the walls and circled in the air, cawing and noisily flapping their wings. Together with that sound came a solitary human cry from the gateway and amid the smoke appeared the figure of a bareheaded man in a peasant&rsquo;s coat. He grasped a musket and took aim at the French.</p>",
  "page-1204": "<p> &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; repeated the officer once more, and the reports of a musket and of two cannon shots were heard simultaneously. The gate was again hidden by smoke.</p><p>Nothing more stirred behind the screens and the French infantry soldiers and officers advanced to the gate. In the gateway lay three wounded and four dead. Two men in peasant coats ran away at the foot of the wall, toward the Známenka.</p><p>&ldquo;Clear that away!&rdquo; said the officer, pointing to the beams and the corpses, and the French soldiers, after dispatching the wounded, threw the corpses over the parapet.</p><p>Who these men were nobody knew. &ldquo;Clear that away!&rdquo; was all that was said of them, and they were thrown over the parapet and removed later on that they might not stink.</p>",
  "page-1205": "<p> Thiers alone dedicates a few eloquent lines to their memory: &ldquo;These wretches had occupied the sacred citadel, having supplied themselves with guns from the arsenal, and fired&rdquo; (the wretches) &ldquo;at the French. Some of them were sabered and the Krémlin was purged of their presence.&rdquo;</p><p>Murat was informed that the way had been cleared. The French entered the gates and began pitching their camp in the Senate Square. Out of the windows of the Senate House the soldiers threw chairs into the Square for fuel and kindled fires there.</p><p>Other detachments passed through the Krémlin and encamped along the Moroséyka, the Lubyánka, and Pokróvka Streets. Others quartered themselves along the Vozdvízhenka, the Nikólski, and the Tverskóy Streets. No masters of the houses being found anywhere, the French were not billeted on the inhabitants as is usual in towns but lived in it as in a camp.</p>",
  "page-1206": "<p>Though tattered, hungry, worn out, and reduced to a third of their original number, the French entered Moscow in good marching order. It was a weary and famished, but still a fighting and menacing army. But it remained an army only until its soldiers had dispersed into their different lodgings. As soon as the men of the various regiments began to disperse among the wealthy and deserted houses, the army was lost forever and there came into being something nondescript, neither citizens nor soldiers but what are known as marauders. When five weeks later these same men left Moscow, they no longer formed an army. They were a mob of marauders, each carrying a quantity of articles which seemed to him valuable or useful. The aim of each man when he left Moscow was no longer, as it had been, to conquer, but merely to keep what he had acquired.</p>",
  "page-1207": "<p> Like a monkey which puts its paw into the narrow neck of a jug, and having seized a handful of nuts will not open its fist for fear of losing what it holds, and therefore perishes, the French when they left Moscow had inevitably to perish because they carried their loot with them, yet to abandon what they had stolen was as impossible for them as it is for the monkey to open its paw and let go of its nuts. Ten minutes after each regiment had entered a Moscow district, not a soldier or officer was left. Men in military uniforms and Hessian boots could be seen through the windows, laughing and walking through the rooms. In cellars and storerooms similar men were busy among the provisions, and in the yards unlocking or breaking open coach house and stable doors, lighting fires in kitchens and kneading and baking bread with rolled-up sleeves, and cooking; or frightening, amusing, or caressing women and children. There were many such men both in the shops and houses&mdash;but there was no army.</p>",
  "page-1208": "<p>Order after order was issued by the French commanders that day forbidding the men to disperse about the town, sternly forbidding any violence to the inhabitants or any looting, and announcing a roll call for that very evening. But despite all these measures the men, who had till then constituted an army, flowed all over the wealthy, deserted city with its comforts and plentiful supplies. As a hungry herd of cattle keeps well together when crossing a barren field, but gets out of hand and at once disperses uncontrollably as soon as it reaches rich pastures, so did the army disperse all over the wealthy city.</p><p>No residents were left in Moscow, and the soldiers&mdash;like water percolating through sand&mdash;spread irresistibly through the city in all directions from the Krémlin into which they had first marched.</p>",
  "page-1209": "<p> The cavalry, on entering a merchant&rsquo;s house that had been abandoned and finding there stabling more than sufficient for their horses, went on, all the same, to the next house which seemed to them better. Many of them appropriated several houses, chalked their names on them, and quarreled and even fought with other companies for them. Before they had had time to secure quarters the soldiers ran out into the streets to see the city and, hearing that everything had been abandoned, rushed to places where valuables were to be had for the taking. The officers followed to check the soldiers and were involuntarily drawn into doing the same. In Carriage Row carriages had been left in the shops, and generals flocked there to select calèches and coaches for themselves. The few inhabitants who had remained invited commanding officers to their houses, hoping thereby to secure themselves from being plundered.</p>",
  "page-1210": "<p> There were masses of wealth and there seemed no end to it. All around the quarters occupied by the French were other regions still unexplored and unoccupied where, they thought, yet greater riches might be found. And Moscow engulfed the army ever deeper and deeper. When water is spilled on dry ground both the dry ground and the water disappear and mud results; and in the same way the entry of the famished army into the rich and deserted city resulted in fires and looting and the destruction of both the army and the wealthy city.</p><p>The French attributed the Fire of Moscow au patriotisme féroce de Rostopchíne, * the Russians to the barbarity of the French. In reality, however, it was not, and could not be, possible to explain the burning of Moscow by making any individual, or any group of people, responsible for it.</p>",
  "page-1211": "<p> Moscow was burned because it found itself in a position in which any town built of wood was bound to burn, quite apart from whether it had, or had not, a hundred and thirty inferior fire engines. Deserted Moscow had to burn as inevitably as a heap of shavings has to burn on which sparks continually fall for several days. A town built of wood, where scarcely a day passes without conflagrations when the house owners are in residence and a police force is present, cannot help burning when its inhabitants have left it and it is occupied by soldiers who smoke pipes, make campfires of the Senate chairs in the Senate Square, and cook themselves meals twice a day. In peacetime it is only necessary to billet troops in the villages of any district and the number of fires in that district immediately increases.</p>",
  "page-1212": "<p> How much then must the probability of fire be increased in an abandoned, wooden town where foreign troops are quartered. &ldquo;Le patriotisme féroce de Rostopchíne&rdquo; and the barbarity of the French were not to blame in the matter. Moscow was set on fire by the soldiers&rsquo; pipes, kitchens, and campfires, and by the carelessness of enemy soldiers occupying houses they did not own. Even if there was any arson (which is very doubtful, for no one had any reason to burn the houses&mdash;in any case a troublesome and dangerous thing to do), arson cannot be regarded as the cause, for the same thing would have happened without any incendiarism.</p><p>However tempting it might be for the French to blame Rostopchín&rsquo;</p>",
  "page-1213": "<p>s ferocity and for Russians to blame the scoundrel Bonaparte, or later on to place an heroic torch in the hands of their own people, it is impossible not to see that there could be no such direct cause of the fire, for Moscow had to burn as every village, factory, or house must burn which is left by its owners and in which strangers are allowed to live and cook their porridge. Moscow was burned by its inhabitants, it is true, but by those who had abandoned it and not by those who remained in it. Moscow when occupied by the enemy did not remain intact like Berlin, Vienna, and other towns, simply because its inhabitants abandoned it and did not welcome the French with bread and salt, nor bring them the keys of the city.</p>",

He was completely obsessed by one persistent thought. He did not know how or when this thought had taken such possession of him, but he remembered nothing of the past, understood nothing of the present, and all he saw and heard appeared to him like a dream.</p><p>He had left home only to escape the intricate tangle of life&rsquo;s demands that enmeshed him, and which in his present condition he was unable to unravel. He had gone to Joseph Alexéevich&rsquo;s house, on the plea of sorting the deceased&rsquo;s books and papers, only in search of rest from life&rsquo;</p>",
  "page-1216": "<p>s turmoil, for in his mind the memory of Joseph Alexéevich was connected with a world of eternal, solemn, and calm thoughts, quite contrary to the restless confusion into which he felt himself being drawn. He sought a quiet refuge, and in Joseph Alexéevich&rsquo;s study he really found it. When he sat with his elbows on the dusty writing table in the deathlike stillness of the study, calm and significant memories of the last few days rose one after another in his imagination, particularly of the battle of Borodinó and of that vague sense of his own insignificance and insincerity compared with the truth, simplicity, and strength of the class of men he mentally classed as they. When Gerásim roused him from his reverie the idea occurred to him of taking part in the popular defense of Moscow which he knew was projected.</p>",
  "page-1217": "<p> And with that object he had asked Gerásim to get him a peasant&rsquo;s coat and a pistol, confiding to him his intentions of remaining in Joseph Alexéevich&rsquo;s house and keeping his name secret. Then during the first day spent in inaction and solitude (he tried several times to fix his attention on the Masonic manuscripts, but was unable to do so) the idea that had previously occurred to him of the cabalistic significance of his name in connection with Bonaparte&rsquo;s more than once vaguely presented itself. But the idea that he, L&rsquo;russe Besuhof, was destined to set a limit to the power of the Beast was as yet only one of the fancies that often passed through his mind and left no trace behind.</p><p>When, having bought the coat merely with the object of taking part among the people in the defense of Moscow,</p>",
  "page-1218": "<p>Pierre had met the Rostóvs and Natásha had said to him: &ldquo;Are you remaining in Moscow?... How splendid!&rdquo; the thought flashed into his mind that it really would be a good thing, even if Moscow were taken, for him to remain there and do what he was predestined to do.</p><p>Next day, with the sole idea of not sparing himself and not lagging in any way behind them, Pierre went to the Three Hills gate. But when he returned to the house convinced that Moscow would not be defended, he suddenly felt that what before had seemed to him merely a possibility had now become absolutely necessary and inevitable. He must remain in Moscow, concealing his name, and must meet Napoleon and kill him, and either perish or put an end to the misery of all Europe&mdash;which it seemed to him was solely due to Napoleon.</p>",
  "page-1219": "<p>Pierre knew all the details of the attempt on Bonaparte&rsquo;s life in 1809 by a German student in Vienna, and knew that the student had been shot. And the risk to which he would expose his life by carrying out his design excited him still more.</p><p>Two equally strong feelings drew Pierre irresistibly to this purpose. The first was a feeling of the necessity of sacrifice and suffering in view of the common calamity, the same feeling that had caused him to go to Mozháysk on the twenty-fifth and to make his way to the very thick of the battle and had now caused him to run away from his home and, in place of the luxury and comfort to which he was accustomed, to sleep on a hard sofa without undressing and eat the same food as Gerásim.</p>",
  "page-1220": "<p> The other was that vague and quite Russian feeling of contempt for everything conventional, artificial, and human&mdash;for everything the majority of men regard as the greatest good in the world. Pierre had first experienced this strange and fascinating feeling at the Slobóda Palace, when he had suddenly felt that wealth, power, and life&mdash;all that men so painstakingly acquire and guard&mdash;if it has any worth has so only by reason of the joy with which it can all be renounced.</p><p>It was the feeling that induces a volunteer recruit to spend his last penny on drink, and a drunken man to smash mirrors or glasses for no apparent reason and knowing that it will cost him all the money he possesses: the feeling which causes a man to perform actions which from an ordinary point of view are insane, to test, as it were, his personal power and strength, affirming the existence of a higher, nonhuman criterion of life.</p>",
  "page-1221": "<p>From the very day Pierre had experienced this feeling for the first time at the Slobóda Palace he had been continuously under its influence, but only now found full satisfaction for it. Moreover, at this moment Pierre was supported in his design and prevented from renouncing it by what he had already done in that direction. If he were now to leave Moscow like everyone else, his flight from home, the peasant coat, the pistol, and his announcement to the Rostóvs that he would remain in Moscow would all become not merely meaningless but contemptible and ridiculous, and to this Pierre was very sensitive.</p><p>Pierre&rsquo;s physical condition, as is always the case, corresponded to his mental state. The unaccustomed coarse food, the vodka he drank during those days, the absence of wine and cigars, his dirty unchanged linen, two almost sleepless nights passed on a short sofa without bedding&mdash;all this kept him in a state of excitement bordering on insanity.</p>",
  "page-1222": "<p>It was two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. The French had already entered Moscow. Pierre knew this, but instead of acting he only thought about his undertaking, going over its minutest details in his mind. In his fancy he did not clearly picture to himself either the striking of the blow or the death of Napoleon, but with extraordinary vividness and melancholy enjoyment imagined his own destruction and heroic endurance.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, alone, for the sake of all, I must do it or perish!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Yes, I will approach... and then suddenly... with pistol or dagger? But that is all the same! &lsquo;It is not I but the hand of Providence that punishes thee,&rsquo; I shall say,&rdquo; thought he, imagining what he would say when killing Napoleon. &ldquo;Well then, take me and execute me!&rdquo; he went on, speaking to himself and bowing his head with a sad but firm expression.</p>",
  "page-1223": "<p>While Pierre, standing in the middle of the room, was talking to himself in this way, the study door opened and on the threshold appeared the figure of Makár Alexéevich, always so timid before but now quite transformed.</p><p>His dressing gown was unfastened, his face red and distorted. He was obviously drunk. On seeing Pierre he grew confused at first, but noticing embarrassment on Pierre&rsquo;s face immediately grew bold and, staggering on his thin legs, advanced into the middle of the room.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re frightened,&rdquo; he said confidentially in a hoarse voice. &ldquo;I say I won&rsquo;t surrender, I say... Am I not right, sir?&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1224": "<p>He paused and then suddenly seeing the pistol on the table seized it with unexpected rapidity and ran out into the corridor.</p><p>Gerásim and the porter, who had followed Makár Alexéevich, stopped him in the vestibule and tried to take the pistol from him. Pierre, coming out into the corridor, looked with pity and repulsion at the half-crazy old man. Makár Alexéevich, frowning with exertion, held on to the pistol and screamed hoarsely, evidently with some heroic fancy in his head.</p><p>&ldquo;To arms! Board them! No, you shan&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; he yelled.</p><p>&ldquo;That will do, please, that will do. Have the goodness&mdash;please, sir, to let go! Please, sir...&rdquo; pleaded Gerásim, trying carefully to steer Makár Alexéevich by the elbows back to the door.</p>",
  "page-1225": "<p>&ldquo;Who are you? Bonaparte!...&rdquo; shouted Makár Alexéevich.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not right, sir. Come to your room, please, and rest. Allow me to have the pistol.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be off, thou base slave! Touch me not! See this?&rdquo; shouted Makár Alexéevich, brandishing the pistol. &ldquo;Board them!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Catch hold!&rdquo; whispered Gerásim to the porter.</p><p>They seized Makár Alexéevich by the arms and dragged him to the door.</p><p>The vestibule was filled with the discordant sounds of a struggle and of a tipsy, hoarse voice.</p>",
  "page-1226": "<p>Suddenly a fresh sound, a piercing feminine scream, reverberated from the porch and the cook came running into the vestibule.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s them! Gracious heavens! O Lord, four of them, horsemen!&rdquo; she cried.</p><p>Gerásim and the porter let Makár Alexéevich go, and in the now silent corridor the sound of several hands knocking at the front door could be heard.</p>",
  "page-1227": "<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>",
  "page-1228": "<p>Pierre, having decided that until he had carried out his design he would disclose neither his identity nor his knowledge of French, stood at the half-open door of the corridor, intending to conceal himself as soon as the French entered. But the French entered and still Pierre did not retire&mdash;an irresistible curiosity kept him there.</p><p>There were two of them. One was an officer&mdash;a tall, soldierly, handsome man&mdash;the other evidently a private or an orderly, sunburned, short, and thin, with sunken cheeks and a dull expression. The officer walked in front, leaning on a stick and slightly limping. When he had advanced a few steps he stopped, having apparently decided that these were good quarters, turned round to the soldiers standing at the entrance, and in a loud voice of command ordered them to put up the horses.</p>",
  "page-1229": "<p> Having done that, the officer, lifting his elbow with a smart gesture, stroked his mustache and lightly touched his hat.</p><p>&ldquo;Bonjour, la compagnie!&rdquo; * said he gaily, smiling and looking about him.</p><p>No one gave any reply.</p><p>&ldquo;Vous êtes le bourgeois?&rdquo; * the officer asked Gerásim.</p><p>Gerásim gazed at the officer with an alarmed and inquiring look.</p><p>&ldquo;Quartier, quartier, logement!&rdquo; said the officer, looking down at the little man with a condescending and good-natured smile. &ldquo;Les français sont de bons enfants. Que diable! Voyons! Ne nous fâchons pas, mon vieux!&rdquo; * added he, clapping the scared and silent Gerásim on the shoulder.</p>",
  "page-1230": "<p> &ldquo;Well, does no one speak French in this establishment?&rdquo; he asked again in French, looking around and meeting Pierre&rsquo;s eyes. Pierre moved away from the door.</p><p>Again the officer turned to Gerásim and asked him to show him the rooms in the house.</p><p>&ldquo;Master, not here&mdash;don&rsquo;t understand... me, you...&rdquo; said Gerásim, trying to render his words more comprehensible by contorting them.</p><p>Still smiling, the French officer spread out his hands before Gerásim&rsquo;s nose, intimating that he did not understand him either, and moved, limping, to the door at which Pierre was standing. Pierre wished to go away and conceal himself, but at that moment he saw Makár Alexéevich appearing at the open kitchen door with the pistol in his hand. With a madman&rsquo;s cunning, Makár Alexéevich eyed the Frenchman, raised his pistol, and took aim.</p>",
  "page-1231": "<p>&ldquo;Board them!&rdquo; yelled the tipsy man, trying to press the trigger. Hearing the yell the officer turned round, and at the same moment Pierre threw himself on the drunkard. Just when Pierre snatched at and struck up the pistol Makár Alexéevich at last got his fingers on the trigger, there was a deafening report, and all were enveloped in a cloud of smoke. The Frenchman turned pale and rushed to the door.</p><p>Forgetting his intention of concealing his knowledge of French, Pierre, snatching away the pistol and throwing it down, ran up to the officer and addressed him in French.</p><p>&ldquo;You are not wounded?&rdquo; he asked.</p>",
  "page-1232": "<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; answered the Frenchman, feeling himself over. &ldquo;But I have had a lucky escape this time,&rdquo; he added, pointing to the damaged plaster of the wall. &ldquo;Who is that man?&rdquo; said he, looking sternly at Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I am really in despair at what has occurred,&rdquo; said Pierre rapidly, quite forgetting the part he had intended to play. &ldquo;He is an unfortunate madman who did not know what he was doing.&rdquo;</p><p>The officer went up to Makár Alexéevich and took him by the collar.</p><p>Makár Alexéevich was standing with parted lips, swaying, as if about to fall asleep, as he leaned against the wall.</p>",
  "page-1233": "<p>&ldquo;Brigand! You shall pay for this,&rdquo; said the Frenchman, letting go of him. &ldquo;We French are merciful after victory, but we do not pardon traitors,&rdquo; he added, with a look of gloomy dignity and a fine energetic gesture.</p><p>Pierre continued, in French, to persuade the officer not to hold that drunken imbecile to account. The Frenchman listened in silence with the same gloomy expression, but suddenly turned to Pierre with a smile. For a few seconds he looked at him in silence. His handsome face assumed a melodramatically gentle expression and he held out his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;You have saved my life. You are French,&rdquo; said he.</p>",
  "page-1234": "<p>For a Frenchman that deduction was indubitable. Only a Frenchman could perform a great deed, and to save his life&mdash;the life of M. Ramballe, captain of the 13th Light Regiment&mdash;was undoubtedly a very great deed.</p><p>But however indubitable that conclusion and the officer&rsquo;s conviction based upon it, Pierre felt it necessary to disillusion him.</p><p>&ldquo;I am Russian,&rdquo; he said quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;Tut, tut, tut! Tell that to others,&rdquo; said the officer, waving his finger before his nose and smiling. &ldquo;You shall tell me all about that presently. I am delighted to meet a compatriot. Well, and what are we to do with this man?&rdquo; he added, addressing himself to Pierre as to a brother.</p>",
  "page-1235": "<p>Even if Pierre were not a Frenchman, having once received that loftiest of human appellations he could not renounce it, said the officer&rsquo;s look and tone. In reply to his last question Pierre again explained who Makár Alexéevich was and how just before their arrival that drunken imbecile had seized the loaded pistol which they had not had time to recover from him, and begged the officer to let the deed go unpunished.</p><p>The Frenchman expanded his chest and made a majestic gesture with his arm.</p><p>&ldquo;You have saved my life! You are French. You ask his pardon? I grant it you. Lead that man away!&rdquo; said he quickly and energetically, and taking the arm of Pierre whom he had promoted to be a Frenchman for saving his life, he went with him into the room.</p>",
  "page-1236": "<p>The soldiers in the yard, hearing the shot, came into the passage asking what had happened, and expressed their readiness to punish the culprits, but the officer sternly checked them.</p><p>&ldquo;You will be called in when you are wanted,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>The soldiers went out again, and the orderly, who had meanwhile had time to visit the kitchen, came up to his officer.</p><p>&ldquo;Captain, there is soup and a leg of mutton in the kitchen,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Shall I serve them up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, and some wine,&rdquo; answered the captain.</p>",
  "page-1237": "<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>",
  "page-1238": "<p>When the French officer went into the room with Pierre the latter again thought it his duty to assure him that he was not French and wished to go away, but the officer would not hear of it. He was so very polite, amiable, good-natured, and genuinely grateful to Pierre for saving his life that Pierre had not the heart to refuse, and sat down with him in the parlor&mdash;the first room they entered. To Pierre&rsquo;s assurances that he was not a Frenchman, the captain, evidently not understanding how anyone could decline so flattering an appellation, shrugged his shoulders and said that if Pierre absolutely insisted on passing for a Russian let it be so, but for all that he would be forever bound to Pierre by gratitude for saving his life.</p>",
  "page-1239": "<p>Had this man been endowed with the slightest capacity for perceiving the feelings of others, and had he at all understood what Pierre&rsquo;s feelings were, the latter would probably have left him, but the man&rsquo;s animated obtuseness to everything other than himself disarmed Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;A Frenchman or a Russian prince incognito,&rdquo; said the officer, looking at Pierre&rsquo;s fine though dirty linen and at the ring on his finger. &ldquo;I owe my life to you and offer you my friendship. A Frenchman never forgets either an insult or a service. I offer you my friendship. That is all I can say.&rdquo;</p><p>There was so much good nature and nobility (in the French sense of the word) in the officer&rsquo;s voice, in the expression of his face and in his gestures, that Pierre, unconsciously smiling in response to the Frenchman&rsquo;s smile, pressed the hand held out to him.</p>",
  "page-1240": "<p>&ldquo;Captain Ramballe, of the 13th Light Regiment, Chevalier of the Legion of Honor for the affair on the seventh of September,&rdquo; he introduced himself, a self-satisfied irrepressible smile puckering his lips under his mustache. &ldquo;Will you now be so good as to tell me with whom I have the honor of conversing so pleasantly, instead of being in the ambulance with that maniac&rsquo;s bullet in my body?&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre replied that he could not tell him his name and, blushing, began to try to invent a name and to say something about his reason for concealing it, but the Frenchman hastily interrupted him.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, please!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I understand your reasons. You are an officer... a superior officer perhaps. You have borne arms against us. That&rsquo;s not my business. I owe you my life. That is enough for me. I am quite at your service.</p>",
  "page-1241": "<p> You belong to the gentry?&rdquo; he concluded with a shade of inquiry in his tone. Pierre bent his head. &ldquo;Your baptismal name, if you please. That is all I ask. Monsieur Pierre, you say.... That&rsquo;s all I want to know.&rdquo;</p><p>When the mutton and an omelet had been served and a samovar and vodka brought, with some wine which the French had taken from a Russian cellar and brought with them, Ramballe invited Pierre to share his dinner, and himself began to eat greedily and quickly like a healthy and hungry man, munching his food rapidly with his strong teeth, continually smacking his lips, and repeating&mdash;&ldquo;Excellent! Delicious!&rdquo; His face grew red and was covered with perspiration. Pierre was hungry and shared the dinner with pleasure. Morel, the orderly, brought some hot water in a saucepan and placed a bottle of claret in it.</p>",
  "page-1242": "<p> He also brought a bottle of kvass, taken from the kitchen for them to try. That beverage was already known to the French and had been given a special name. They called it limonade de cochon (pig&rsquo;s lemonade), and Morel spoke well of the limonade de cochon he had found in the kitchen. But as the captain had the wine they had taken while passing through Moscow, he left the kvass to Morel and applied himself to the bottle of Bordeaux. He wrapped the bottle up to its neck in a table napkin and poured out wine for himself and for Pierre. The satisfaction of his hunger and the wine rendered the captain still more lively and he chatted incessantly all through dinner.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear Monsieur Pierre, I owe you a fine votive candle for saving me from that maniac.... You see, I have bullets enough in my body already.</p>",
  "page-1243": "<p> Here is one I got at Wagram&rdquo; (he touched his side) &ldquo;and a second at Smolénsk&rdquo;&mdash;he showed a scar on his cheek&mdash;&ldquo;and this leg which as you see does not want to march, I got that on the seventh at the great battle of la Moskowa. Sacré Dieu! It was splendid! That deluge of fire was worth seeing. It was a tough job you set us there, my word! You may be proud of it! And on my honor, in spite of the cough I caught there, I should be ready to begin again. I pity those who did not see it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was there,&rdquo; said Pierre.</p>",
  "page-1244": "<p>&ldquo;Bah, really? So much the better! You are certainly brave foes. The great redoubt held out well, by my pipe!&rdquo; continued the Frenchman. &ldquo;And you made us pay dear for it. I was at it three times&mdash;sure as I sit here. Three times we reached the guns and three times we were thrown back like cardboard figures. Oh, it was beautiful, Monsieur Pierre! Your grenadiers were splendid, by heaven! I saw them close up their ranks six times in succession and march as if on parade. Fine fellows! Our King of Naples, who knows what&rsquo;s what, cried &lsquo;Bravo!&rsquo; Ha, ha! So you are one of us soldiers!&rdquo; he added, smiling, after a momentary pause. &ldquo;So much the better, so much the better, Monsieur Pierre! Terrible in battle... gallant...</p>",
  "page-1245": "<p> with the fair&rdquo; (he winked and smiled), &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what the French are, Monsieur Pierre, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p><p>The captain was so naïvely and good-humoredly gay, so real, and so pleased with himself that Pierre almost winked back as he looked merrily at him. Probably the word &ldquo;gallant&rdquo; turned the captain&rsquo;s thoughts to the state of Moscow.</p><p>&ldquo;Apropos, tell me please, is it true that the women have all left Moscow? What a queer idea! What had they to be afraid of?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Would not the French ladies leave Paris if the Russians entered it?&rdquo; asked Pierre.</p>",
  "page-1246": "<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo; The Frenchman emitted a merry, sanguine chuckle, patting Pierre on the shoulder. &ldquo;What a thing to say!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Paris?... But Paris, Paris...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Paris&mdash;the capital of the world,&rdquo; Pierre finished his remark for him.</p><p>The captain looked at Pierre. He had a habit of stopping short in the middle of his talk and gazing intently with his laughing, kindly eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, if you hadn&rsquo;t told me you were Russian, I should have wagered that you were Parisian! You have that... I don&rsquo;t know what, that...&rdquo; and having uttered this compliment, he again gazed at him in silence.</p>",
  "page-1247": "<p>&ldquo;I have been in Paris. I spent years there,&rdquo; said Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yes, one sees that plainly. Paris!... A man who doesn&rsquo;t know Paris is a savage. You can tell a Parisian two leagues off. Paris is Talma, la Duchénois, Potier, the Sorbonne, the boulevards,&rdquo; and noticing that his conclusion was weaker than what had gone before, he added quickly: &ldquo;There is only one Paris in the world. You have been to Paris and have remained Russian. Well, I don&rsquo;t esteem you the less for it.&rdquo;</p><p>Under the influence of the wine he had drunk, and after the days he had spent alone with his depressing thoughts, Pierre involuntarily enjoyed talking with this cheerful and good-natured man.</p>",
  "page-1248": "<p>&ldquo;To return to your ladies&mdash;I hear they are lovely. What a wretched idea to go and bury themselves in the steppes when the French army is in Moscow. What a chance those girls have missed! Your peasants, now&mdash;that&rsquo;s another thing; but you civilized people, you ought to know us better than that. We took Vienna, Berlin, Madrid, Naples, Rome, Warsaw, all the world&rsquo;s capitals.... We are feared, but we are loved. We are nice to know. And then the Emperor...&rdquo; he began, but Pierre interrupted him.</p><p>&ldquo;The Emperor,&rdquo; Pierre repeated, and his face suddenly became sad and embarrassed, &ldquo;is the Emperor...?&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1249": "<p>&ldquo;The Emperor? He is generosity, mercy, justice, order, genius&mdash;that&rsquo;s what the Emperor is! It is I, Ramballe, who tell you so.... I assure you I was his enemy eight years ago. My father was an emigrant count.... But that man has vanquished me. He has taken hold of me. I could not resist the sight of the grandeur and glory with which he has covered France. When I understood what he wanted&mdash;when I saw that he was preparing a bed of laurels for us, you know, I said to myself: &lsquo;That is a monarch,&rsquo; and I devoted myself to him! So there! Oh yes, mon cher, he is the greatest man of the ages past or future.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1250": "<p>&ldquo;Is he in Moscow?&rdquo; Pierre stammered with a guilty look.</p><p>The Frenchman looked at his guilty face and smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;No, he will make his entry tomorrow,&rdquo; he replied, and continued his talk.</p><p>Their conversation was interrupted by the cries of several voices at the gate and by Morel, who came to say that some Württemberg hussars had come and wanted to put up their horses in the yard where the captain&rsquo;s horses were. This difficulty had arisen chiefly because the hussars did not understand what was said to them in French.</p><p>The captain had their senior sergeant called in, and in a stern voice asked him to what regiment he belonged, who was his commanding officer, and by what right he allowed himself to claim quarters that were already occupied.</p>",
  "page-1251": "<p> The German who knew little French, answered the two first questions by giving the names of his regiment and of his commanding officer, but in reply to the third question which he did not understand said, introducing broken French into his own German, that he was the quartermaster of the regiment and his commander had ordered him to occupy all the houses one after another. Pierre, who knew German, translated what the German said to the captain and gave the captain&rsquo;s reply to the Württemberg hussar in German. When he had understood what was said to him, the German submitted and took his men elsewhere. The captain went out into the porch and gave some orders in a loud voice.</p><p>When he returned to the room Pierre was sitting in the same place as before, with his head in his hands. His face expressed suffering. He really was suffering at that moment.</p>",
  "page-1252": "<p> When the captain went out and he was left alone, suddenly he came to himself and realized the position he was in. It was not that Moscow had been taken or that the happy conquerors were masters in it and were patronizing him. Painful as that was it was not that which tormented Pierre at the moment. He was tormented by the consciousness of his own weakness. The few glasses of wine he had drunk and the conversation with this good-natured man had destroyed the mood of concentrated gloom in which he had spent the last few days and which was essential for the execution of his design. The pistol, dagger, and peasant coat were ready. Napoleon was to enter the town next day. Pierre still considered that it would be a useful and worthy action to slay the evildoer, but now he felt that he would not do it. He did not know why, but he felt a foreboding that he would not carry out his intention.</p>",
  "page-1253": "<p> He struggled against the confession of his weakness but dimly felt that he could not overcome it and that his former gloomy frame of mind, concerning vengeance, killing, and self-sacrifice, had been dispersed like dust by contact with the first man he met.</p><p>The captain returned to the room, limping slightly and whistling a tune.</p><p>The Frenchman&rsquo;s chatter which had previously amused Pierre now repelled him. The tune he was whistling, his gait, and the gesture with which he twirled his mustache, all now seemed offensive. &ldquo;I will go away immediately. I won&rsquo;t say another word to him,&rdquo; thought Pierre. He thought this, but still sat in the same place. A strange feeling of weakness tied him to the spot; he wished to get up and go away, but could not do so.</p>",
  "page-1254": "<p>The captain, on the other hand, seemed very cheerful. He paced up and down the room twice. His eyes shone and his mustache twitched as if he were smiling to himself at some amusing thought.</p><p>&ldquo;The colonel of those Württembergers is delightful,&rdquo; he suddenly said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a German, but a nice fellow all the same.... But he&rsquo;s a German.&rdquo; He sat down facing Pierre. &ldquo;By the way, you know German, then?&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre looked at him in silence.</p><p>&ldquo;What is the German for &lsquo;shelter&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shelter?&rdquo; Pierre repeated. &ldquo;The German for shelter is Unterkunft.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1255": "<p>&ldquo;How do you say it?&rdquo; the captain asked quickly and doubtfully.</p><p>&ldquo;Unterkunft,&rdquo; Pierre repeated.</p><p>&ldquo;Onterkoff,&rdquo; said the captain and looked at Pierre for some seconds with laughing eyes. &ldquo;These Germans are first-rate fools, don&rsquo;t you think so, Monsieur Pierre?&rdquo; he concluded.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s have another bottle of this Moscow Bordeaux, shall we? Morel will warm us up another little bottle. Morel!&rdquo; he called out gaily.</p><p>Morel brought candles and a bottle of wine. The captain looked at Pierre by the candlelight and was evidently struck by the troubled expression on his companion&rsquo;s face. Ramballe, with genuine distress and sympathy in his face, went up to Pierre and bent over him.</p>",
  "page-1256": "<p>&ldquo;There now, we&rsquo;re sad,&rdquo; said he, touching Pierre&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Have I upset you? No, really, have you anything against me?&rdquo; he asked Pierre. &ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s the state of affairs?&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre did not answer, but looked cordially into the Frenchman&rsquo;s eyes whose expression of sympathy was pleasing to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Honestly, without speaking of what I owe you, I feel friendship for you. Can I do anything for you? Dispose of me. It is for life and death. I say it with my hand on my heart!&rdquo; said he, striking his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Pierre.</p>",
  "page-1257": "<p>The captain gazed intently at him as he had done when he learned that &ldquo;shelter&rdquo; was Unterkunft in German, and his face suddenly brightened.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, in that case, I drink to our friendship!&rdquo; he cried gaily, filling two glasses with wine.</p><p>Pierre took one of the glasses and emptied it. Ramballe emptied his too, again pressed Pierre&rsquo;s hand, and leaned his elbows on the table in a pensive attitude.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear friend,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;such is fortune&rsquo;s caprice. Who would have said that I should be a soldier and a captain of dragoons in the service of Bonaparte, as we used to call him? Yet here I am in Moscow with him. I must tell you, mon cher,&rdquo; he continued in the sad and measured tones of a man who intends to tell a long story, &ldquo;that our name is one of the most ancient in France.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1258": "<p>And with a Frenchman&rsquo;s easy and naïve frankness the captain told Pierre the story of his ancestors, his childhood, youth, and manhood, and all about his relations and his financial and family affairs, &ldquo;ma pauvre mère&rdquo; playing of course an important part in the story.</p><p>&ldquo;But all that is only life&rsquo;s setting, the real thing is love&mdash;love! Am I not right, Monsieur Pierre?&rdquo; said he, growing animated. &ldquo;Another glass?&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre again emptied his glass and poured himself out a third.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, women, women!&rdquo; and the captain, looking with glistening eyes at Pierre, began talking of love and of his love affairs.</p>",
  "page-1259": "<p>There were very many of these, as one could easily believe, looking at the officer&rsquo;s handsome, self-satisfied face, and noting the eager enthusiasm with which he spoke of women. Though all Ramballe&rsquo;s love stories had the sensual character which Frenchmen regard as the special charm and poetry of love, yet he told his story with such sincere conviction that he alone had experienced and known all the charm of love and he described women so alluringly that Pierre listened to him with curiosity.</p><p>It was plain that l&rsquo;amour which the Frenchman was so fond of was not that low and simple kind that Pierre had once felt for his wife, nor was it the romantic love stimulated by himself that he experienced for Natásha. (Ramballe despised both these kinds of love equally: the one he considered the &ldquo;love of clodhoppers&rdquo; and the other the &ldquo;love of simpletons.</p>",
  "page-1260": "<p>&rdquo;) L&rsquo;amour which the Frenchman worshiped consisted principally in the unnaturalness of his relation to the woman and in a combination of incongruities giving the chief charm to the feeling.</p><p>Thus the captain touchingly recounted the story of his love for a fascinating marquise of thirty-five and at the same time for a charming, innocent child of seventeen, daughter of the bewitching marquise. The conflict of magnanimity between the mother and the daughter, ending in the mother&rsquo;s sacrificing herself and offering her daughter in marriage to her lover, even now agitated the captain, though it was the memory of a distant past. Then he recounted an episode in which the husband played the part of the lover, and he&mdash;the lover&mdash;assumed the role of the husband, as well as several droll incidents from his recollections of Germany, where &ldquo;shelter&rdquo; is called Unterkunft and where the husbands eat sauerkraut and the young girls are &ldquo;too blonde.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1261": "<p>Finally, the latest episode in Poland still fresh in the captain&rsquo;s memory, and which he narrated with rapid gestures and glowing face, was of how he had saved the life of a Pole (in general, the saving of life continually occurred in the captain&rsquo;s stories) and the Pole had entrusted to him his enchanting wife (parisienne de cœur) while himself entering the French service. The captain was happy, the enchanting Polish lady wished to elope with him, but, prompted by magnanimity, the captain restored the wife to the husband, saying as he did so: &ldquo;I have saved your life, and I save your honor!&rdquo; Having repeated these words the captain wiped his eyes and gave himself a shake, as if driving away the weakness which assailed him at this touching recollection.</p>",
  "page-1262": "<p>Listening to the captain&rsquo;s tales, Pierre&mdash;as often happens late in the evening and under the influence of wine&mdash;followed all that was told him, understood it all, and at the same time followed a train of personal memories which, he knew not why, suddenly arose in his mind. While listening to these love stories his own love for Natásha unexpectedly rose to his mind, and going over the pictures of that love in his imagination he mentally compared them with Ramballe&rsquo;s tales. Listening to the story of the struggle between love and duty, Pierre saw before his eyes every minutest detail of his last meeting with the object of his love at the Súkharev water tower. At the time of that meeting it had not produced an effect upon him&mdash;he had not even once recalled it. But now it seemed to him that that meeting had had in it something very important and poetic.</p>",
  "page-1263": "<p>&ldquo;Peter Kirílovich, come here! We have recognized you,&rdquo; he now seemed to hear the words she had uttered and to see before him her eyes, her smile, her traveling hood, and a stray lock of her hair... and there seemed to him something pathetic and touching in all this.</p><p>Having finished his tale about the enchanting Polish lady, the captain asked Pierre if he had ever experienced a similar impulse to sacrifice himself for love and a feeling of envy of the legitimate husband.</p><p>Challenged by this question Pierre raised his head and felt a need to express the thoughts that filled his mind. He began to explain that he understood love for a woman somewhat differently. He said that in all his life he had loved and still loved only one woman, and that she could never be his.</p>",
  "page-1264": "<p>&ldquo;Tiens!&rdquo; said the captain.</p><p>Pierre then explained that he had loved this woman from his earliest years, but that he had not dared to think of her because she was too young, and because he had been an illegitimate son without a name. Afterwards when he had received a name and wealth he dared not think of her because he loved her too well, placing her far above everything in the world, and especially therefore above himself.</p><p>When he had reached this point, Pierre asked the captain whether he understood that.</p><p>The captain made a gesture signifying that even if he did not understand it he begged Pierre to continue.</p>",
  "page-1265": "<p>&ldquo;Platónic love, clouds...&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p>Whether it was the wine he had drunk, or an impulse of frankness, or the thought that this man did not, and never would, know any of those who played a part in his story, or whether it was all these things together, something loosened Pierre&rsquo;s tongue. Speaking thickly and with a faraway look in his shining eyes, he told the whole story of his life: his marriage, Natásha&rsquo;s love for his best friend, her betrayal of him, and all his own simple relations with her. Urged on by Ramballe&rsquo;s questions he also told what he had at first concealed&mdash;his own position and even his name.</p>",
  "page-1266": "<p>More than anything else in Pierre&rsquo;s story the captain was impressed by the fact that Pierre was very rich, had two mansions in Moscow, and that he had abandoned everything and not left the city, but remained there concealing his name and station.</p><p>When it was late at night they went out together into the street. The night was warm and light. To the left of the house on the Pokróvka a fire glowed&mdash;the first of those that were beginning in Moscow. To the right and high up in the sky was the sickle of the waning moon and opposite to it hung that bright comet which was connected in Pierre&rsquo;s heart with his love. At the gate stood Gerásim, the cook, and two Frenchmen. Their laughter and their mutually incomprehensible remarks in two languages could be heard. They were looking at the glow seen in the town.</p>",
  "page-1267": "<p>There was nothing terrible in the one small, distant fire in the immense city.</p><p>Gazing at the high starry sky, at the moon, at the comet, and at the glow from the fire, Pierre experienced a joyful emotion. &ldquo;There now, how good it is, what more does one need?&rdquo; thought he. And suddenly remembering his intention he grew dizzy and felt so faint that he leaned against the fence to save himself from falling.</p><p>Without taking leave of his new friend, Pierre left the gate with unsteady steps and returning to his room lay down on the sofa and immediately fell asleep.</p>",
  "page-1268": "<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>",
  "page-1269": "<p>The glow of the first fire that began on the second of September was watched from the various roads by the fugitive Muscovites and by the retreating troops, with many different feelings.</p><p>The Rostóv party spent the night at Mytíshchi, fourteen miles from Moscow. They had started so late on the first of September, the road had been so blocked by vehicles and troops, so many things had been forgotten for which servants were sent back, that they had decided to spend that night at a place three miles out of Moscow. The next morning they woke late and were again delayed so often that they only got as far as Great Mytíshchi. At ten o&rsquo;clock that evening the Rostóv family and the wounded traveling with them were all distributed in the yards and huts of that large village.</p>",

The awful pain he suffered made him moan incessantly and piteously, and his moaning sounded terrible in the darkness of the autumn night. He had spent the first night in the same yard as the Rostóvs. The countess said she had been unable to close her eyes on account of his moaning, and at Mytíshchi she moved into a worse hut simply to be farther away from the wounded man.</p><p>In the darkness of the night one of the servants noticed, above the high body of a coach standing before the porch, the small glow of another fire.</p>",
  "page-1271": "<p> One glow had long been visible and everybody knew that it was Little Mytíshchi burning&mdash;set on fire by Mamónov&rsquo;s Cossacks.</p><p>&ldquo;But look here, brothers, there&rsquo;s another fire!&rdquo; remarked an orderly.</p><p>All turned their attention to the glow.</p><p>&ldquo;But they told us Little Mytíshchi had been set on fire by Mamónov&rsquo;s Cossacks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not Mytíshchi, it&rsquo;s farther away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look, it must be in Moscow!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1272": "<p>Two of the gazers went round to the other side of the coach and sat down on its steps.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more to the left, why, Little Mytíshchi is over there, and this is right on the other side.&rdquo;</p><p>Several men joined the first two.</p><p>&ldquo;See how it&rsquo;s flaring,&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fire in Moscow: either in the Sushchévski or the Rogózhski quarter.&rdquo;</p><p>No one replied to this remark and for some time they all gazed silently at the spreading flames of the second fire in the distance.</p>",
  "page-1273": "<p>Old Daniel Teréntich, the count&rsquo;s valet (as he was called), came up to the group and shouted at Míshka.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you staring at, you good-for-nothing?...

Doesn&rsquo;t it look as if that glow were in Moscow?&rdquo; remarked one of the footmen.</p><p>Daniel Teréntich made no reply, and again for a long time they were all silent. The glow spread, rising and falling, farther and farther still.</p>",
  "page-1274": "<p>&ldquo;God have mercy.... It&rsquo;s windy and dry...&rdquo; said another voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Just look! See what it&rsquo;s doing now. O Lord! You can even see the crows flying. Lord have mercy on us sinners!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll put it out, no fear!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s to put it out?&rdquo; Daniel Teréntich, who had hitherto been silent, was heard to say. His voice was calm and deliberate. &ldquo;Moscow it is, brothers,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Mother Moscow, the white...&rdquo; his voice faltered, and he gave way to an old man&rsquo;s sob.</p>",
  "page-1275": "<p>And it was as if they had all only waited for this to realize the significance for them of the glow they were watching. Sighs were heard, words of prayer, and the sobbing of the count&rsquo;s old valet.</p>",

  "page-1277": "<p>The valet, returning to the cottage, informed the count that Moscow was burning. The count donned his dressing gown and went out to look. Sónya and Madame Schoss, who had not yet undressed, went out with him. Only Natásha and the countess remained in the room. Pétya was no longer with the family, he had gone on with his regiment which was making for Tróitsa.</p><p>The countess, on hearing that Moscow was on fire, began to cry. Natásha, pale, with a fixed look, was sitting on the bench under the icons just where she had sat down on arriving and paid no attention to her father&rsquo;s words. She was listening to the ceaseless moaning of the adjutant, three houses off.</p>",
  "page-1278": "<p>&ldquo;Oh, how terrible,&rdquo; said Sónya returning from the yard chilled and frightened. &ldquo;I believe the whole of Moscow will burn, there&rsquo;s an awful glow! Natásha, do look! You can see it from the window,&rdquo; she said to her cousin, evidently wishing to distract her mind.</p><p>But Natásha looked at her as if not understanding what was said to her and again fixed her eyes on the corner of the stove. She had been in this condition of stupor since the morning, when Sónya, to the surprise and annoyance of the countess, had for some unaccountable reason found it necessary to tell Natásha of Prince Andrew&rsquo;s wound and of his being with their party. The countess had seldom been so angry with anyone as she was with Sónya. Sónya had cried and begged to be forgiven and now, as if trying to atone for her fault, paid unceasing attention to her cousin.</p>",
  "page-1279": "<p>&ldquo;Look, Natásha, how dreadfully it is burning!&rdquo; said she.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s burning?&rdquo; asked Natásha. &ldquo;Oh, yes, Moscow.&rdquo;</p><p>And as if in order not to offend Sónya and to get rid of her, she turned her face to the window, looked out in such a way that it was evident that she could not see anything, and again settled down in her former attitude.</p><p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t see it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, really I did,&rdquo; Natásha replied in a voice that pleaded to be left in peace.</p>",
  "page-1280": "<p>Both the countess and Sónya understood that, naturally, neither Moscow nor the burning of Moscow nor anything else could seem of importance to Natásha.</p><p>The count returned and lay down behind the partition. The countess went up to her daughter and touched her head with the back of her hand as she was wont to do when Natásha was ill, then touched her forehead with her lips as if to feel whether she was feverish, and finally kissed her.</p><p>&ldquo;You are cold. You are trembling all over. You&rsquo;d better lie down,&rdquo; said the countess.</p><p>&ldquo;Lie down? All right, I will. I&rsquo;ll lie down at once,&rdquo; said Natásha.</p>",
  "page-1281": "<p>When Natásha had been told that morning that Prince Andrew was seriously wounded and was traveling with their party, she had at first asked many questions: Where was he going? How was he wounded? Was it serious? And could she see him? But after she had been told that she could not see him, that he was seriously wounded but that his life was not in danger, she ceased to ask questions or to speak at all, evidently disbelieving what they told her, and convinced that say what she might she would still be told the same. All the way she had sat motionless in a corner of the coach with wide open eyes, and the expression in them which the countess knew so well and feared so much, and now she sat in the same way on the bench where she had seated herself on arriving. She was planning something and either deciding or had already decided something in her mind. The countess knew this, but what it might be she did not know, and this alarmed and tormented her.</p>",
  "page-1282": "<p>&ldquo;Natásha, undress, darling; lie down on my bed.&rdquo;</p><p>A bed had been made on a bedstead for the countess only. Madame Schoss and the two girls were to sleep on some hay on the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;No, Mamma, I will lie down here on the floor,&rdquo; Natásha replied irritably and she went to the window and opened it. Through the open window the moans of the adjutant could be heard more distinctly. She put her head out into the damp night air, and the countess saw her slim neck shaking with sobs and throbbing against the window frame. Natásha knew it was not Prince Andrew who was moaning. She knew Prince Andrew was in the same yard as themselves and in a part of the hut across the passage; but this dreadful incessant moaning made her sob. The countess exchanged a look with Sónya.</p>",
  "page-1283": "<p>&ldquo;Lie down, darling; lie down, my pet,&rdquo; said the countess, softly touching Natásha&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;Come, lie down.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes... I&rsquo;ll lie down at once,&rdquo; said Natásha, and began hurriedly undressing, tugging at the tapes of her petticoat.</p><p>When she had thrown off her dress and put on a dressing jacket, she sat down with her foot under her on the bed that had been made up on the floor, jerked her thin and rather short plait of hair to the front, and began replaiting it. Her long, thin, practiced fingers rapidly unplaited, replaited, and tied up her plait. Her head moved from side to side from habit, but her eyes, feverishly wide, looked fixedly before her. When her toilet for the night was finished she sank gently onto the sheet spread over the hay on the side nearest the door.</p>",
  "page-1284": "<p>&ldquo;Natásha, you&rsquo;d better lie in the middle,&rdquo; said Sónya.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay here,&rdquo; muttered Natásha. &ldquo;Do lie down,&rdquo; she added crossly, and buried her face in the pillow.</p><p>The countess, Madame Schoss, and Sónya undressed hastily and lay down. The small lamp in front of the icons was the only light left in the room. But in the yard there was a light from the fire at Little Mytíshchi a mile and a half away, and through the night came the noise of people shouting at a tavern Mamónov&rsquo;s Cossacks had set up across the street, and the adjutant&rsquo;s unceasing moans could still be heard.</p>",
  "page-1285": "<p>For a long time Natásha listened attentively to the sounds that reached her from inside and outside the room and did not move. First she heard her mother praying and sighing and the creaking of her bed under her, then Madame Schoss&rsquo; familiar whistling snore and Sónya&rsquo;s gentle breathing. Then the countess called to Natásha. Natásha did not answer.</p><p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s asleep, Mamma,&rdquo; said Sónya softly.</p><p>After a short silence the countess spoke again but this time no one replied.</p><p>Soon after that Natásha heard her mother&rsquo;s even breathing. Natásha did not move, though her little bare foot, thrust out from under the quilt, was growing cold on the bare floor.</p>",
  "page-1286": "<p>As if to celebrate a victory over everybody, a cricket chirped in a crack in the wall. A cock crowed far off and another replied near by. The shouting in the tavern had died down; only the moaning of the adjutant was heard. Natásha sat up.</p><p>&ldquo;Sónya, are you asleep? Mamma?&rdquo; she whispered.</p><p>No one replied. Natásha rose slowly and carefully, crossed herself, and stepped cautiously on the cold and dirty floor with her slim, supple, bare feet. The boards of the floor creaked. Stepping cautiously from one foot to the other she ran like a kitten the few steps to the door and grasped the cold door handle.</p>",
  "page-1287": "<p>It seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically against all the walls of the room: it was her own heart, sinking with alarm and terror and overflowing with love.</p><p>She opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto the cold, damp earthen floor of the passage. The cold she felt refreshed her. With her bare feet she touched a sleeping man, stepped over him, and opened the door into the part of the hut where Prince Andrew lay. It was dark in there. In the farthest corner, on a bench beside a bed on which something was lying, stood a tallow candle with a long, thick, and smoldering wick.</p><p>From the moment she had been told that morning of Prince Andrew&rsquo;s wound and his presence there, Natásha had resolved to see him.</p>",
  "page-1288": "<p> She did not know why she had to, she knew the meeting would be painful, but felt the more convinced that it was necessary.</p><p>All day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night. But now that the moment had come she was filled with dread of what she might see. How was he maimed? What was left of him? Was he like that incessant moaning of the adjutant&rsquo;s? Yes, he was altogether like that. In her imagination he was that terrible moaning personified. When she saw an indistinct shape in the corner, and mistook his knees raised under the quilt for his shoulders, she imagined a horrible body there, and stood still in terror. But an irresistible impulse drew her forward. She cautiously took one step and then another, and found herself in the middle of a small room containing baggage.</p>",
  "page-1289": "<p> Another man&mdash;Timókhin&mdash;was lying in a corner on the benches beneath the icons, and two others&mdash;the doctor and a valet&mdash;lay on the floor.</p><p>The valet sat up and whispered something. Timókhin, kept awake by the pain in his wounded leg, gazed with wide-open eyes at this strange apparition of a girl in a white chemise, dressing jacket, and nightcap. The valet&rsquo;s sleepy, frightened exclamation, &ldquo;What do you want? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; made Natásha approach more swiftly to what was lying in the corner. Horribly unlike a man as that body looked, she must see him. She passed the valet, the snuff fell from the candle wick, and she saw Prince Andrew clearly with his arms outside the quilt, and such as she had always seen him.</p>",
  "page-1290": "<p>He was the same as ever, but the feverish color of his face, his glittering eyes rapturously turned toward her, and especially his neck, delicate as a child&rsquo;s, revealed by the turn-down collar of his shirt, gave him a peculiarly innocent, childlike look, such as she had never seen on him before. She went up to him and with a swift, flexible, youthful movement dropped on her knees.</p><p>He smiled and held out his hand to her.</p>",
  "page-1291": "<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>",
  "page-1292": "<p>Seven days had passed since Prince Andrew found himself in the ambulance station on the field of Borodinó. His feverish state and the inflammation of his bowels, which were injured, were in the doctor&rsquo;s opinion sure to carry him off. But on the seventh day he ate with pleasure a piece of bread with some tea, and the doctor noticed that his temperature was lower. He had regained consciousness that morning. The first night after they left Moscow had been fairly warm and he had remained in the calèche, but at Mytíshchi the wounded man himself asked to be taken out and given some tea. The pain caused by his removal into the hut had made him groan aloud and again lose consciousness. When he had been placed on his camp bed he lay for a long time motionless with closed eyes.</p>",
  "page-1293": "<p> Then he opened them and whispered softly: &ldquo;And the tea?&rdquo; His remembering such a small detail of everyday life astonished the doctor. He felt Prince Andrew&rsquo;s pulse, and to his surprise and dissatisfaction found it had improved. He was dissatisfied because he knew by experience that if his patient did not die now, he would do so a little later with greater suffering. Timókhin, the red-nosed major of Prince Andrew&rsquo;s regiment, had joined him in Moscow and was being taken along with him, having been wounded in the leg at the battle of Borodinó. They were accompanied by a doctor, Prince Andrew&rsquo;s valet, his coachman, and two orderlies.</p><p>They gave Prince Andrew some tea. He drank it eagerly, looking with feverish eyes at the door in front of him as if trying to understand and remember something.</p>",
  "page-1294": "<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any more. Is Timókhin here?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>Timókhin crept along the bench to him.</p><p>&ldquo;I am here, your excellency.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your wound?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mine, sir? All right. But how about you?&rdquo;</p><p>Prince Andrew again pondered as if trying to remember something.</p><p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t one get a book?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;What book?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Gospels. I haven&rsquo;t one.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1295": "<p>The doctor promised to procure it for him and began to ask how he was feeling. Prince Andrew answered all his questions reluctantly but reasonably, and then said he wanted a bolster placed under him as he was uncomfortable and in great pain. The doctor and valet lifted the cloak with which he was covered and, making wry faces at the noisome smell of mortifying flesh that came from the wound, began examining that dreadful place. The doctor was very much displeased about something and made a change in the dressings, turning the wounded man over so that he groaned again and grew unconscious and delirious from the agony. He kept asking them to get him the book and put it under him.</p>",
  "page-1296": "<p>&ldquo;What trouble would it be to you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have not got one. Please get it for me and put it under for a moment,&rdquo; he pleaded in a piteous voice.</p><p>The doctor went into the passage to wash his hands.</p><p>&ldquo;You fellows have no conscience,&rdquo; said he to the valet who was pouring water over his hands. &ldquo;For just one moment I didn&rsquo;t look after you... It&rsquo;s such pain, you know, that I wonder how he can bear it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By the Lord Jesus Christ, I thought we had put something under him!&rdquo; said the valet.</p>",
  "page-1297": "<p>The first time Prince Andrew understood where he was and what was the matter with him and remembered being wounded and how was when he asked to be carried into the hut after his calèche had stopped at Mytíshchi. After growing confused from pain while being carried into the hut he again regained consciousness, and while drinking tea once more recalled all that had happened to him, and above all vividly remembered the moment at the ambulance station when, at the sight of the sufferings of a man he disliked, those new thoughts had come to him which promised him happiness. And those thoughts, though now vague and indefinite, again possessed his soul. He remembered that he had now a new source of happiness and that this happiness had something to do with the Gospels. That was why he asked for a copy of them.</p>",
  "page-1298": "<p> The uncomfortable position in which they had put him and turned him over again confused his thoughts, and when he came to himself a third time it was in the complete stillness of the night. Everybody near him was sleeping. A cricket chirped from across the passage; someone was shouting and singing in the street; cockroaches rustled on the table, on the icons, and on the walls, and a big fly flopped at the head of the bed and around the candle beside him, the wick of which was charred and had shaped itself like a mushroom.</p><p>His mind was not in a normal state. A healthy man usually thinks of, feels, and remembers innumerable things simultaneously, but has the power and will to select one sequence of thoughts or events on which to fix his whole attention.</p>",
  "page-1299": "<p> A healthy man can tear himself away from the deepest reflections to say a civil word to someone who comes in and can then return again to his own thoughts. But Prince Andrew&rsquo;s mind was not in a normal state in that respect. All the powers of his mind were more active and clearer than ever, but they acted apart from his will. Most diverse thoughts and images occupied him simultaneously. At times his brain suddenly began to work with a vigor, clearness, and depth it had never reached when he was in health, but suddenly in the midst of its work it would turn to some unexpected idea and he had not the strength to turn it back again.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, a new happiness was revealed to me of which man cannot be deprived,&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1300": "<p> he thought as he lay in the semidarkness of the quiet hut, gazing fixedly before him with feverish wide open eyes. &ldquo;A happiness lying beyond material forces, outside the material influences that act on man&mdash;a happiness of the soul alone, the happiness of loving. Every man can understand it, but to conceive it and enjoin it was possible only for God. But how did God enjoin that law? And why was the Son...?&rdquo;</p><p>And suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke off, and Prince Andrew heard (without knowing whether it was a delusion or reality) a soft whispering voice incessantly and rhythmically repeating &ldquo;piti-piti-piti,&rdquo; and then &ldquo;titi,&rdquo; and then again &ldquo;piti-piti-piti,&rdquo; and &ldquo;ti-ti&rdquo; once more. At the same time he felt that above his face, above the very middle of it, some strange airy structure was being erected out of slender needles or splinters, to the sound of this whispered music.</p>",
  "page-1301": "<p> He felt that he had to balance carefully (though it was difficult) so that this airy structure should not collapse; but nevertheless it kept collapsing and again slowly rising to the sound of whispered rhythmic music&mdash;&ldquo;it stretches, stretches, spreading out and stretching,&rdquo; said Prince Andrew to himself. While listening to this whispering and feeling the sensation of this drawing out and the construction of this edifice of needles, he also saw by glimpses a red halo round the candle, and heard the rustle of the cockroaches and the buzzing of the fly that flopped against his pillow and his face. Each time the fly touched his face it gave him a burning sensation and yet to his surprise it did not destroy the structure, though it knocked against the very region of his face where it was rising. But besides this there was something else of importance. It was something white by the door&mdash;the statue of a sphinx, which also oppressed him.</p>",
  "page-1302": "<p>&ldquo;But perhaps that&rsquo;s my shirt on the table,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s my legs, and that is the door, but why is it always stretching and drawing itself out, and &lsquo;piti-piti-piti&rsquo; and &lsquo;ti-ti&rsquo; and &lsquo;piti-piti-piti&rsquo;...? That&rsquo;s enough, please leave off!&rdquo; Prince Andrew painfully entreated someone. And suddenly thoughts and feelings again swam to the surface of his mind with peculiar clearness and force.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;love,&rdquo; he thought again quite clearly. &ldquo;But not love which loves for something, for some quality, for some purpose, or for some reason, but the love which I&mdash;while dying&mdash;first experienced when I saw my enemy and yet loved him. I experienced that feeling of love which is the very essence of the soul and does not require an object. Now again I feel that bliss.</p>",
  "page-1303": "<p> To love one&rsquo;s neighbors, to love one&rsquo;s enemies, to love everything, to love God in all His manifestations. It is possible to love someone dear to you with human love, but an enemy can only be loved by divine love. That is why I experienced such joy when I felt that I loved that man. What has become of him? Is he alive?...</p><p>&ldquo;When loving with human love one may pass from love to hatred, but divine love cannot change. No, neither death nor anything else can destroy it. It is the very essence of the soul. Yet how many people have I hated in my life? And of them all, I loved and hated none as I did her.&rdquo; And he vividly pictured to himself Natásha, not as he had done in the past with nothing but her charms which gave him delight, but for the first time picturing to himself her soul.</p>",
  "page-1304": "<p> And he understood her feelings, her sufferings, shame, and remorse. He now understood for the first time all the cruelty of his rejection of her, the cruelty of his rupture with her. &ldquo;If only it were possible for me to see her once more! Just once, looking into those eyes to say...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Piti-piti-piti and ti-ti and piti-piti-piti boom!&rdquo; flopped the fly.... And his attention was suddenly carried into another world, a world of reality and delirium in which something particular was happening. In that world some structure was still being erected and did not fall, something was still stretching out, and the candle with its red halo was still burning, and the same shirtlike sphinx lay near the door; but besides all this something creaked, there was a whiff of fresh air, and a new white sphinx appeared, standing at the door.</p>",
  "page-1305": "<p> And that sphinx had the pale face and shining eyes of the very Natásha of whom he had just been thinking.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, how oppressive this continual delirium is,&rdquo; thought Prince Andrew, trying to drive that face from his imagination. But the face remained before him with the force of reality and drew nearer. Prince Andrew wished to return to that former world of pure thought, but he could not, and delirium drew him back into its domain. The soft whispering voice continued its rhythmic murmur, something oppressed him and stretched out, and the strange face was before him. Prince Andrew collected all his strength in an effort to recover his senses, he moved a little, and suddenly there was a ringing in his ears, a dimness in his eyes, and like a man plunged into water he lost consciousness.</p>",
  "page-1306": "<p> When he came to himself, Natásha, that same living Natásha whom of all people he most longed to love with this new pure divine love that had been revealed to him, was kneeling before him. He realized that it was the real living Natásha, and he was not surprised but quietly happy. Natásha, motionless on her knees (she was unable to stir), with frightened eyes riveted on him, was restraining her sobs. Her face was pale and rigid. Only in the lower part of it something quivered.</p><p>Prince Andrew sighed with relief, smiled, and held out his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How fortunate!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1307": "<p>With a rapid but careful movement Natásha drew nearer to him on her knees and, taking his hand carefully, bent her face over it and began kissing it, just touching it lightly with her lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Forgive me!&rdquo; she whispered, raising her head and glancing at him. &ldquo;Forgive me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; said Prince Andrew.</p><p>&ldquo;Forgive...!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Forgive what?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Forgive me for what I ha-ve do-ne!&rdquo; faltered Natásha in a scarcely audible, broken whisper, and began kissing his hand more rapidly, just touching it with her lips.</p>",
  "page-1308": "<p>&ldquo;I love you more, better than before,&rdquo; said Prince Andrew, lifting her face with his hand so as to look into her eyes.</p><p>Those eyes, filled with happy tears, gazed at him timidly, compassionately, and with joyous love. Natásha&rsquo;s thin pale face, with its swollen lips, was more than plain&mdash;it was dreadful. But Prince Andrew did not see that, he saw her shining eyes which were beautiful. They heard the sound of voices behind them.</p><p>Peter the valet, who was now wide awake, had roused the doctor. Timókhin, who had not slept at all because of the pain in his leg, had long been watching all that was going on, carefully covering his bare body with the sheet as he huddled up on his bench.</p>",
  "page-1309": "<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; said the doctor, rising from his bed. &ldquo;Please go away, madam!&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment a maid sent by the countess, who had noticed her daughter&rsquo;s absence, knocked at the door.</p><p>Like a somnambulist aroused from her sleep Natásha went out of the room and, returning to her hut, fell sobbing on her bed.</p><p>From that time, during all the rest of the Rostóvs&rsquo; journey, at every halting place and wherever they spent a night, Natásha never left the wounded Bolkónski, and the doctor had to admit that he had not expected from a young girl either such firmness or such skill in nursing a wounded man.</p>",
  "page-1310": "<p>Dreadful as the countess imagined it would be should Prince Andrew die in her daughter&rsquo;s arms during the journey&mdash;as, judging by what the doctor said, it seemed might easily happen&mdash;she could not oppose Natásha. Though with the intimacy now established between the wounded man and Natásha the thought occurred that should he recover their former engagement would be renewed, no one&mdash;least of all Natásha and Prince Andrew&mdash;spoke of this: the unsettled question of life and death, which hung not only over Bolkónski but over all Russia, shut out all other considerations.</p>",
  "page-1311": "<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>",
  "page-1312": "<p>On the third of September Pierre awoke late. His head was aching, the clothes in which he had slept without undressing felt uncomfortable on his body, and his mind had a dim consciousness of something shameful he had done the day before. That something shameful was his yesterday&rsquo;s conversation with Captain Ramballe.</p><p>It was eleven by the clock, but it seemed peculiarly dark out of doors. Pierre rose, rubbed his eyes, and seeing the pistol with an engraved stock which Gerásim had replaced on the writing table, he remembered where he was and what lay before him that very day.</p><p>&ldquo;Am I not too late?&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;No, probably he won&rsquo;t make his entry into Moscow before noon.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1313": "<p>Pierre did not allow himself to reflect on what lay before him, but hastened to act.</p><p>After arranging his clothes, he took the pistol and was about to go out. But it then occurred to him for the first time that he certainly could not carry the weapon in his hand through the streets. It was difficult to hide such a big pistol even under his wide coat. He could not carry it unnoticed in his belt or under his arm. Besides, it had been discharged, and he had not had time to reload it. &ldquo;No matter, the dagger will do,&rdquo; he said to himself, though when planning his design he had more than once come to the conclusion that the chief mistake made by the student in 1809 had been to try to kill Napoleon with a dagger.</p>",
  "page-1314": "<p> But as his chief aim consisted not in carrying out his design, but in proving to himself that he would not abandon his intention and was doing all he could to achieve it, Pierre hastily took the blunt jagged dagger in a green sheath which he had bought at the Súkharev market with the pistol, and hid it under his waistcoat.</p><p>Having tied a girdle over his coat and pulled his cap low on his head, Pierre went down the corridor, trying to avoid making a noise or meeting the captain, and passed out into the street.</p><p>The conflagration, at which he had looked with so much indifference the evening before, had greatly increased during the night. Moscow was on fire in several places. The buildings in Carriage Row, across the river, in the Bazaar and the Povarskóy, as well as the barges on the Moskvá River and the timber yards by the Dorogomílov Bridge, were all ablaze.</p>",
  "page-1315": "<p>Pierre&rsquo;s way led through side streets to the Povarskóy and from there to the church of St. Nicholas on the Arbát, where he had long before decided that the deed should be done. The gates of most of the houses were locked and the shutters up. The streets and lanes were deserted. The air was full of smoke and the smell of burning. Now and then he met Russians with anxious and timid faces, and Frenchmen with an air not of the city but of the camp, walking in the middle of the streets. Both the Russians and the French looked at Pierre with surprise. Besides his height and stoutness, and the strange morose look of suffering in his face and whole figure, the Russians stared at Pierre because they could not make out to what class he could belong.</p>",
  "page-1316": "<p> The French followed him with astonishment in their eyes chiefly because Pierre, unlike all the other Russians who gazed at the French with fear and curiosity, paid no attention to them. At the gate of one house three Frenchmen, who were explaining something to some Russians who did not understand them, stopped Pierre asking if he did not know French.</p><p>Pierre shook his head and went on. In another side street a sentinel standing beside a green caisson shouted at him, but only when the shout was threateningly repeated and he heard the click of the man&rsquo;s musket as he raised it did Pierre understand that he had to pass on the other side of the street. He heard nothing and saw nothing of what went on around him. He carried his resolution within himself in terror and haste, like something dreadful and alien to him, for, after the previous night&rsquo;s experience, he was afraid of losing it.</p>",
  "page-1317": "<p> But he was not destined to bring his mood safely to his destination. And even had he not been hindered by anything on the way, his intention could not now have been carried out, for Napoleon had passed the Arbát more than four hours previously on his way from the Dorogomílov suburb to the Krémlin, and was now sitting in a very gloomy frame of mind in a royal study in the Krémlin, giving detailed and exact orders as to measures to be taken immediately to extinguish the fire, to prevent looting, and to reassure the inhabitants. But Pierre did not know this; he was entirely absorbed in what lay before him, and was tortured&mdash;as those are who obstinately undertake a task that is impossible for them not because of its difficulty but because of its incompatibility with their natures&mdash;by the fear of weakening at the decisive moment and so losing his self-esteem.</p>",
  "page-1318": "<p>Though he heard and saw nothing around him he found his way by instinct and did not go wrong in the side streets that led to the Povarskóy.</p><p>As Pierre approached that street the smoke became denser and denser&mdash;he even felt the heat of the fire. Occasionally curly tongues of flame rose from under the roofs of the houses. He met more people in the streets and they were more excited. But Pierre, though he felt that something unusual was happening around him, did not realize that he was approaching the fire. As he was going along a footpath across a wide-open space adjoining the Povarskóy on one side and the gardens of Prince Gruzínski&rsquo;s house on the other, Pierre suddenly heard the desperate weeping of a woman close to him. He stopped as if awakening from a dream and lifted his head.</p>",
  "page-1319": "<p>By the side of the path, on the dusty dry grass, all sorts of household goods lay in a heap: featherbeds, a samovar, icons, and trunks. On the ground, beside the trunks, sat a thin woman no longer young, with long, prominent upper teeth, and wearing a black cloak and cap. This woman, swaying to and fro and muttering something, was choking with sobs. Two girls of about ten and twelve, dressed in dirty short frocks and cloaks, were staring at their mother with a look of stupefaction on their pale frightened faces. The youngest child, a boy of about seven, who wore an overcoat and an immense cap evidently not his own, was crying in his old nurse&rsquo;s arms. A dirty, barefooted maid was sitting on a trunk, and, having undone her pale-colored plait, was pulling it straight and sniffing at her singed hair.</p>",
  "page-1320": "<p> The woman&rsquo;s husband, a short, round-shouldered man in the undress uniform of a civilian official, with sausage-shaped whiskers and showing under his square-set cap the hair smoothly brushed forward over his temples, with expressionless face was moving the trunks, which were placed one on another, and was dragging some garments from under them.</p><p>As soon as she saw Pierre, the woman almost threw herself at his feet.</p><p>&ldquo;Dear people, good Christians, save me, help me, dear friends... help us, somebody,&rdquo; she muttered between her sobs. &ldquo;My girl... My daughter! My youngest daughter is left behind. She&rsquo;s burned! Ooh! Was it for this I nursed you.... Ooh!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1321": "<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Mary Nikoláevna!&rdquo; said her husband to her in a low voice, evidently only to justify himself before the stranger. &ldquo;Sister must have taken her, or else where can she be?&rdquo; he added.</p><p>&ldquo;Monster! Villain!&rdquo; shouted the woman angrily, suddenly ceasing to weep. &ldquo;You have no heart, you don&rsquo;t feel for your own child! Another man would have rescued her from the fire. But this is a monster and neither a man nor a father! You, honored sir, are a noble man,&rdquo; she went on, addressing Pierre rapidly between her sobs. &ldquo;The fire broke out alongside, and blew our way, the maid called out &lsquo;Fire!&rsquo; and we rushed to collect our things. We ran out just as we were.... This is what we have brought away.... The icons, and my dowry bed, all the rest is lost. We seized the children. But not Katie! Ooh! O Lord!...&rdquo; and again she began to sob. &ldquo;My child, my dear one! Burned, burned!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1322": "<p>&ldquo;But where was she left?&rdquo; asked Pierre.</p><p>From the expression of his animated face the woman saw that this man might help her.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, dear sir!&rdquo; she cried, seizing him by the legs. &ldquo;My benefactor, set my heart at ease.... Aníska, go, you horrid girl, show him the way!&rdquo; she cried to the maid, angrily opening her mouth and still farther exposing her long teeth.</p><p>&ldquo;Show me the way, show me, I... I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; gasped Pierre rapidly.</p><p>The dirty maidservant stepped from behind the trunk, put up her plait, sighed, and went on her short, bare feet along the path. Pierre felt as if he had come back to life after a heavy swoon. He held his head higher, his eyes shone with the light of life, and with swift steps he followed the maid, overtook her, and came out on the Povarskóy.</p>",
  "page-1323": "<p> The whole street was full of clouds of black smoke. Tongues of flame here and there broke through that cloud. A great number of people crowded in front of the conflagration. In the middle of the street stood a French general saying something to those around him. Pierre, accompanied by the maid, was advancing to the spot where the general stood, but the French soldiers stopped him.</p><p>&ldquo;On ne passe pas!&rdquo; * cried a voice.</p><p>&ldquo;This way, uncle,&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pass through the side street, by the Nikúlins&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre turned back, giving a spring now and then to keep up with her. She ran across the street, turned down a side street to the left, and, passing three houses, turned into a yard on the right.</p>",
  "page-1324": "<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s here, close by,&rdquo; said she and, running across the yard, opened a gate in a wooden fence and, stopping, pointed out to him a small wooden wing of the house, which was burning brightly and fiercely. One of its sides had fallen in, another was on fire, and bright flames issued from the openings of the windows and from under the roof.</p><p>As Pierre passed through the fence gate, he was enveloped by hot air and involuntarily stopped.</p><p>&ldquo;Which is it? Which is your house?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Ooh!&rdquo; wailed the girl, pointing to the wing. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, that was our lodging. You&rsquo;ve burned to death, our treasure, Katie, my precious little missy! Ooh!&rdquo; lamented Aníska, who at the sight of the fire felt that she too must give expression to her feelings.</p>",
  "page-1325": "<p>Pierre rushed to the wing, but the heat was so great that he involuntarily passed round in a curve and came upon the large house that was as yet burning only at one end, just below the roof, and around which swarmed a crowd of Frenchmen. At first Pierre did not realize what these men, who were dragging something out, were about; but seeing before him a Frenchman hitting a peasant with a blunt saber and trying to take from him a fox-fur coat, he vaguely understood that looting was going on there, but he had no time to dwell on that idea.</p><p>The sounds of crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings, the whistle and hiss of the flames, the excited shouts of the people, and the sight of the swaying smoke, now gathering into thick black clouds and now soaring up with glittering sparks, with here and there dense</p>",
  "page-1326": "<p>sheaves of flame (now red and now like golden fish scales creeping along the walls), and the heat and smoke and rapidity of motion, produced on Pierre the usual animating effects of a conflagration. It had a peculiarly strong effect on him because at the sight of the fire he felt himself suddenly freed from the ideas that had weighed him down. He felt young, bright, adroit, and resolute. He ran round to the other side of the lodge and was about to dash into that part of it which was still standing, when just above his head he heard several voices shouting and then a cracking sound and the ring of something heavy falling close beside him.</p><p>Pierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some Frenchmen who had just thrown out the drawer of a chest, filled with metal articles. Other French soldiers standing below went up to the drawer.</p>",
  "page-1327": "<p>&ldquo;What does this fellow want?&rdquo; shouted one of them referring to Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a child in that house. Haven&rsquo;t you seen a child?&rdquo; cried Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he talking about? Get along!&rdquo; said several voices, and one of the soldiers, evidently afraid that Pierre might want to take from them some of the plate and bronzes that were in the drawer, moved threateningly toward him.</p><p>&ldquo;A child?&rdquo; shouted a Frenchman from above. &ldquo;I did hear something squealing in the garden. Perhaps it&rsquo;s his brat that the fellow is looking for. After all, one must be human, you know....&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1328": "<p>&ldquo;Where is it? Where?&rdquo; said Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;There! There!&rdquo; shouted the Frenchman at the window, pointing to the garden at the back of the house. &ldquo;Wait a bit&mdash;I&rsquo;m coming down.&rdquo;</p><p>And a minute or two later the Frenchman, a black-eyed fellow with a spot on his cheek, in shirt sleeves, really did jump out of a window on the ground floor, and clapping Pierre on the shoulder ran with him into the garden.</p><p>&ldquo;Hurry up, you others!&rdquo; he called out to his comrades. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting hot.&rdquo;</p><p>When they reached a gravel path behind the house the Frenchman pulled Pierre by the arm and pointed to a round, graveled space where a three-year-old girl in a pink dress was lying under a seat.</p>",
  "page-1329": "<p>&ldquo;There is your child! Oh, a girl, so much the better!&rdquo; said the Frenchman. &ldquo;Good-by, Fatty. We must be human, we are all mortal you know!&rdquo; and the Frenchman with the spot on his cheek ran back to his comrades.</p><p>Breathless with joy, Pierre ran to the little girl and was going to take her in his arms. But seeing a stranger the sickly, scrofulous-looking child, unattractively like her mother, began to yell and run away. Pierre, however, seized her and lifted her in his arms. She screamed desperately and angrily and tried with her little hands to pull Pierre&rsquo;s hands away and to bite them with her slobbering mouth. Pierre was seized by a sense of horror and repulsion such as he had experienced when touching some nasty little animal. But he made an effort not to throw the child down and ran with her to the large house.</p>",
  "page-1330": "<p> It was now, however, impossible to get back the way he had come; the maid, Aníska, was no longer there, and Pierre with a feeling of pity and disgust pressed the wet, painfully sobbing child to himself as tenderly as he could and ran with her through the garden seeking another way out.</p>",
  "page-1331": "<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>",
  "page-1332": "<p>Having run through different yards and side streets, Pierre got back with his little burden to the Gruzínski garden at the corner of the Povarskóy. He did not at first recognize the place from which he had set out to look for the child, so crowded was it now with people and goods that had been dragged out of the houses. Besides Russian families who had taken refuge here from the fire with their belongings, there were several French soldiers in a variety of clothing. Pierre took no notice of them. He hurried to find the family of that civil servant in order to restore the daughter to her mother and go to save someone else. Pierre felt that he had still much to do and to do quickly. Glowing with the heat and from running, he felt at that moment more strongly than ever the sense of youth, animation, and determination that had come on him when he ran to save the child.</p>",
  "page-1333": "<p> She had now become quiet and, clinging with her little hands to Pierre&rsquo;s coat, sat on his arm gazing about her like some little wild animal. He glanced at her occasionally with a slight smile. He fancied he saw something pathetically innocent in that frightened, sickly little face.</p><p>He did not find the civil servant or his wife where he had left them. He walked among the crowd with rapid steps, scanning the various faces he met. Involuntarily he noticed a Georgian or Armenian family consisting of a very handsome old man of Oriental type, wearing a new, cloth-covered, sheepskin coat and new boots, an old woman of similar type, and a young woman. That very young woman seemed to Pierre the perfection of Oriental beauty, with her sharply outlined, arched, black eyebrows and the extraordinarily soft, bright color of her long, beautiful, expressionless face.</p>",
  "page-1334": "<p> Amid the scattered property and the crowd on the open space, she, in her rich satin cloak with a bright lilac shawl on her head, suggested a delicate exotic plant thrown out onto the snow. She was sitting on some bundles a little behind the old woman, and looked from under her long lashes with motionless, large, almond-shaped eyes at the ground before her. Evidently she was aware of her beauty and fearful because of it. Her face struck Pierre and, hurrying along by the fence, he turned several times to look at her. When he had reached the fence, still without finding those he sought, he stopped and looked about him.</p><p>With the child in his arms his figure was now more conspicuous than before, and a group of Russians, both men and women, gathered about him.</p>",
  "page-1335": "<p>&ldquo;Have you lost anyone, my dear fellow? You&rsquo;re of the gentry yourself, aren&rsquo;t you? Whose child is it?&rdquo; they asked him.</p><p>Pierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in a black coat who had been sitting there with her other children, and he asked whether anyone knew where she had gone.</p><p>&ldquo;Why, that must be the Anférovs,&rdquo; said an old deacon, addressing a pockmarked peasant woman. &ldquo;Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy!&rdquo; he added in his customary bass.</p><p>&ldquo;The Anférovs? No,&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;They left in the morning. That must be either Mary Nikoláevna&rsquo;s or the Ivánovs&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1336": "<p>&ldquo;He says &lsquo;a woman,&rsquo; and Mary Nikoláevna is a lady,&rdquo; remarked a house serf.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know her? She&rsquo;s thin, with long teeth,&rdquo; said Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Mary Nikoláevna! They went inside the garden when these wolves swooped down,&rdquo; said the woman, pointing to the French soldiers.</p><p>&ldquo;O Lord, have mercy!&rdquo; added the deacon.</p><p>&ldquo;Go over that way, they&rsquo;re there. It&rsquo;s she! She kept on lamenting and crying,&rdquo; continued the woman. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s she. Here, this way!&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1337": "<p>But Pierre was not listening to the woman. He had for some seconds been intently watching what was going on a few steps away. He was looking at the Armenian family and at two French soldiers who had gone up to them. One of these, a nimble little man, was wearing a blue coat tied round the waist with a rope. He had a nightcap on his head and his feet were bare. The other, whose appearance particularly struck Pierre, was a long, lank, round-shouldered, fair-haired man, slow in his movements and with an idiotic expression of face. He wore a woman&rsquo;s loose gown of frieze, blue trousers, and large torn Hessian boots. The little barefooted Frenchman in the blue coat went up to the Armenians and, saying something, immediately seized the old man by his legs and the old man at once began pulling off his boots.</p>",
  "page-1338": "<p> The other in the frieze gown stopped in front of the beautiful Armenian girl and with his hands in his pockets stood staring at her, motionless and silent.</p><p>&ldquo;Here, take the child!&rdquo; said Pierre peremptorily and hurriedly to the woman, handing the little girl to her. &ldquo;Give her back to them, give her back!&rdquo; he almost shouted, putting the child, who began screaming, on the ground, and again looking at the Frenchman and the Armenian family.</p><p>The old man was already sitting barefoot. The little Frenchman had secured his second boot and was slapping one boot against the other. The old man was saying something in a voice broken by sobs, but Pierre caught but a glimpse of this, his whole attention was directed to the Frenchman in the frieze gown who meanwhile, swaying slowly from side to side, had drawn nearer to the young woman and taking his hands from his pockets had seized her by the neck.</p>",
  "page-1339": "<p>The beautiful Armenian still sat motionless and in the same attitude, with her long lashes drooping as if she did not see or feel what the soldier was doing to her.</p><p>While Pierre was running the few steps that separated him from the Frenchman, the tall marauder in the frieze gown was already tearing from her neck the necklace the young Armenian was wearing, and the young woman, clutching at her neck, screamed piercingly.</p><p>&ldquo;Let that woman alone!&rdquo; exclaimed Pierre hoarsely in a furious voice, seizing the soldier by his round shoulders and throwing him aside.</p><p>The soldier fell, got up, and ran away. But his comrade, throwing down the boots and drawing his sword, moved threateningly toward Pierre.</p>",
  "page-1340": "<p>&ldquo;Voyons, pas de bêtises!&rdquo; * he cried.</p><p>Pierre was in such a transport of rage that he remembered nothing and his strength increased tenfold. He rushed at the barefooted Frenchman and, before the latter had time to draw his sword, knocked him off his feet and hammered him with his fists. Shouts of approval were heard from the crowd around, and at the same moment a mounted patrol of French Uhlans appeared from round the corner. The Uhlans came up at a trot to Pierre and the Frenchman and surrounded them. Pierre remembered nothing of what happened after that. He only remembered beating someone and being beaten and finally feeling that his hands were bound and that a crowd of French soldiers stood around him and were searching him.</p>",
  "page-1341": "<p>&ldquo;Lieutenant, he has a dagger,&rdquo; were the first words Pierre understood.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, a weapon?&rdquo; said the officer and turned to the barefooted soldier who had been arrested with Pierre. &ldquo;All right, you can tell all about it at the court-martial.&rdquo; Then he turned to Pierre. &ldquo;Do you speak French?&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre looked around him with bloodshot eyes and did not reply. His face probably looked very terrible, for the officer said something in a whisper and four more Uhlans left the ranks and placed themselves on both sides of Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you speak French?&rdquo; the officer asked again, keeping at a distance from Pierre. &ldquo;Call the interpreter.&rdquo;</p>",
  "page-1342": "<p>A little man in Russian civilian clothes rode out from the ranks, and by his clothes and manner of speaking Pierre at once knew him to be a French salesman from one of the Moscow shops.</p><p>&ldquo;He does not look like a common man,&rdquo; said the interpreter, after a searching look at Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, he looks very much like an incendiary,&rdquo; remarked the officer. &ldquo;And ask him who he is,&rdquo; he added.</p><p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked the interpreter in poor Russian. &ldquo;You must answer the chief.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will not tell you who I am. I am your prisoner&mdash;take me!&rdquo; Pierre suddenly replied in French.</p>",
  "page-1343": "<p>&ldquo;Ah, ah!&rdquo; muttered the officer with a frown. &ldquo;Well then, march!&rdquo;</p><p>A crowd had collected round the Uhlans. Nearest to Pierre stood the pockmarked peasant woman with the little girl, and when the patrol started she moved forward.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are they taking you to, you poor dear?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;And the little girl, the little girl, what am I to do with her if she&rsquo;s not theirs?&rdquo; said the woman.</p><p>&ldquo;What does that woman want?&rdquo; asked the officer.</p><p>Pierre was as if intoxicated. His elation increased at the sight of the little girl he had saved.</p>",
  "page-1344": "<p>&ldquo;What does she want?&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;She is bringing me my daughter whom I have just saved from the flames,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Good-by!&rdquo; And without knowing how this aimless lie had escaped him, he went along with resolute and triumphant steps between the French soldiers.</p><p>The French patrol was one of those sent out through the various streets of Moscow by Durosnel&rsquo;s order to put a stop to the pillage, and especially to catch the incendiaries who, according to the general opinion which had that day originated among the higher French officers, were the cause of the conflagrations. After marching through a number of streets the patrol arrested five more Russian suspects: a small shopkeeper, two seminary students, a peasant, and a house serf, besides several looters. But of all these various suspected characters, Pierre was considered to be the most suspicious of all.</p>",
  "page-1345": "<p> When they had all been brought for the night to a large house on the Zúbov Rampart that was being used as a guardhouse, Pierre was placed apart under strict guard.</p>",
